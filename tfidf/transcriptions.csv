"1","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After

peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer

"2","EOFire Podcast","David_Shriner-Cahn_5.22.17_3.mp3","what's shaking <Music/Noise> in a jail the here and <Music/Noise> to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty seven of Scio Fire right I would today's most inspiring entrepreneurs seven D The week in goals equal success Fire Nation <Music/Noise> with the Freedom Journal you'll be accomplishing <Music/Noise> goal in one hundred days now show tees feature guest David Schreiner on David are you prepared to eat and I sure am John yes Dave is the go to authority in how to smash a business plateau felt by experience on from yours in professionals he's the speaker consultant and host of the podcasts smashing the plateau he's dedicated to helping business leaders remove the roadblocks that are keeping them from fully achieving their goals and David take a minute fill some gaps from that and Sean give us just a glimpse of your personal life sure so John I started my professional life as a chemical engineer believe it or not <Music/Noise> in Chemical Engineering from core now works as an engineer for a few years and realized that it really wasn't for me long term and I ended up going into leadership and management roles in small to midsize nonprofit organizations did that for over twenty years learned a lot about leadership and management and then decided it was time to launch David and I became an entrepreneur in two thousand and six and since then I started my my entrepreneurial journey as a single person in management consulting business mainly focused on what I had left behind which was the non profit sector and started to pick up some private business clients and things more from them one said in a dive more into your journey coming up here given that the four wheeled kind of curious what you think now today is your area of expertise to break that down force yeah so what I've discovered is that leadership is really lonely there are in particular if you look at somebody who's an experienced leader and take somebody who might be in his or her forties or fifties and that person looks ahead at what he or she dreams to achieve before their story ends you know they've got several decades probably of significant activity and impact they want to make on the world and if for some reason they have hit a roadblock and the gap between where <Music/Noise> and where they want to end up is not getting smaller but in fact it's getting bigger and they look around at what their peers seem to be achieving and frankly social media makes it seem like everybody other than us is achieving breakthroughs all the time that can cause a lot of freaking out and especially for people who are experienced tricks that they use in the past if they're not working it just heightens the anxiety so there's certain things that those people in those scenarios are unlikely to feel comfortable talking to anybody who's close to them that they're not going to talk to their employees because they're the lead of this post to have all the answers they're not going to talk to and they're probably not if they have partners they may not feel comfortable talking to their partners about certain things and if they have investors are probably not going to talk to their investors about these issues and if there's a significant other in their lives spouse or other kind of significant relationship lot of times and I can feel comfortable talking about those issues with their significant other or their significant other may not want to hear them so it's very <Music/Noise> had to use som these kinds of problems that are really complicated as you know leadership is hard work and breakthroughs don't happen quickly they generally happen after lots of steps so what we've done is break breaking down that process so that you can understand what is you need to do and frankly what I've also seen is that there's been an explosion in the coaching industry and there seem to be so many people who are offering help and very frequently that kind of help is not the right kind of help for you so one of the things I've discussed with with three hundred or so podcast guests that I've had on is where <Music/Noise> received grace to help and when I heard over and over again is when you're in a community <Music/Noise> like minded peers who are serious about success committed to a long <Music/Noise> process of mutual support and non judgmental then that dynamic will support innovation and here's why when you listen to the challenges and experiences of others they'll teach you strategies and strategies and tactics that you'll be able to use and I'll give you a couple of examples somebody who's an entirely different industry than your own may be working on a similar kind of problem may have experiences similar similar kind of problem that is applicable to you like let say you hear a story of somebody who's working on contract negotiation and then few weeks later you're working on a contract negotiation and office <Music/Noise> light bulb go off and you realize Oh I can apply what I heard my friend use in a difficult contract negotiation so I lose my shirt and this deal or you might hear somebody who has done a great job growing her profits in an industrial company that inspires you to take a new strategy to grow your profits in a B to B service company so those are great ways for you to be able to apply lessons that other people have learned to your own sector and secondly the act of needing to prepare to explain your challenge to group forces you to unpack things in a way that explaining it to a single person whether that person is a coach or somebody else is not quite the same that the preparation alone can make you realize that you <Music/Noise> the solution in the third step is when you're with a trusted group of peers and you really open about what is challenging you you'll get powerful group thinking you'll hear most of all ways that you can potentially overcome your Roebuck Fire Nation only taken away from this number one is patience you need to have patience like things are not going to happen overnight like you see the social media is out there and everybody's having a huge win these big launch is all these mental breakthroughs emotional breakthroughs business breakthroughs you seen the snapshot you seen all the hard work that went into creating that the combination of a lock at first opportunity all of the sayings comes with you having patience you're going to get to those moments but you have to be patience number two the mastermind if you don't have a group of people the you know like and trust they're going to push you to hold you accountable to support you and guide you then you're struggling and you continue to struggle that's why I and everyone of these episodes by saying hey even hang out with XYZ <Music/Noise> D today so you know you have to fight the police been the most time was theirs to your five Keep up the heat fire nation like gotten find other people one two three four five other people they can to keep that energy on them to keep those lights are going to ignite that excitement within <Music/Noise> David you had a lot of reading your life that's the evidence all the great breakthroughs and Alvin Wiley success and what outcome want you to take us to right <Music/Noise> be what you consider your worst entrepreneurial moment today to take us to that moment David that day tell us that story what happen well the story actually is a pre entrepreneurial moment it was when I left engineering nights spent seven years studying engineering and worked for a few years as I mentioned and when when I <Music/Noise> that it was going to work out that the pivot happened after I was in my second job that two years in the company that I was working for didn't have enough business and a month after I got really great performance review and a big raise my boss calls me into his office and says David have bad news for you nothing to do with your ability your or your performance but you're out of a job and I'm like What am I gonna do that when I was in my late twenties and had expenses et-cetera You know the story a lot of soul searching and in fact I was reflecting on as I was preparing for our discussion today and realize that it was the power of the mastermind tight group that was well facilitated that involve some learning that I was in that propelled me to be able to make a pretty profound change and ignore the naysayers around you thought I was crazy to go into the nonprofit world and that led to a long and very rewarding career that also set the stage for me to have the confidence in the capability to be an entrepreneur that started in two thousand and six Chinese <Music/Noise> the time onto the new ship is risky and you know what let's be frank her some risky things about becoming a notch when you are but how about <Music/Noise> skill and relying on an industry or sector or company or even just a boss for your well being and if that one a those things the industry the company the boss any of those things doesn't work out for a number reasons they are holding this brown paper bag that's just filled with one's skill inside this one skill now what do you do that you would try to find exact same job that you probably aren't the exact same situation this is a different world we live in now and has not been your yes is risky forty doing like you're building up this Swiss Army knife set of skills where one thing happy you could on other roads I mean I've shifted so many times from communities to coaching to products virtually to physical products you know I'm making other ships right now I've recently made my declaration fitness and nutrition I mean you are which of the skill sets you have the power to take on the challenges in the risks are still going to be there the challenges and risks but you're going to be to handle those because you are not you're going to have the sporting guidance of Dave is talking so eloquently about here surround yourself with that mastermind so even just <Music/Noise> his brother one sentence what you want to make sure our listeners get from your worst moment always have a Plan B This is something that I tell people I know who or who are employees people who are entrepreneurs you've always got to have multiple scenarios that you're working on that you're ready to pull the trigger on a moment's notice if you need to sort of like we prepare for fire drill by knowing the steps we can take when there is a fire and as an entrepreneur or as an employee these fires happen and you gotta be prepared to pull the trigger and move quickly when the month when the moment is there and you need to do it yeah <Music/Noise> of the firefighters were hoping her asap and guess what we see the smoke and feel the heat you want to know it today I'll want to make that decision then let's talk about one of the greatest ideas the you that today he had a lot of the year so take us to one of those moments and a walk into the process leadership is lonely but it doesn't have to be lonely you need to be really clear to yourself What is you dream to accomplish and you need to make sure that you understand what success looks like to you and it's not just financial success and is not just business success as you mentioned John you're working on other areas of your life beyond your business we're trying to make some changes and make some improvements we all have these areas to be really clear what successes look like in every area of your life and then make sure you understand what the key performance indicators are so you <Music/Noise> you can measure how successful you are so as not just a bunch of mush right sort of rolling <Music/Noise> there's a way that you can actually measure improvement because leadership is hard work entrepreneurship is hard work success in life is hard work but if you know what the step by step process it is and you know what is your measuring sea can see how successful you are with each step you can constantly improve your tactics so that your success keeps moving forward what does success look like the Fire Nation literally you're listening to my voice right now ask yourself that question what does success look feel smell what is it like healing what does it all those things t o actual fact question if you have a great answer or he still struggling you know there's something to continue to think about and to journal about and meditate about whatever <Music/Noise> do actually think because so many people spend their days with their nose to the Christ only finally take a deep breath and we back in their share ten years later the light wow I was working so hard and this thing is getting me towards this goal this not even what success looks like to me and that when I really look down deep and they began to challenge your brother just a couple sentences I want <Music/Noise> but what does success look like T O having an impact on as many people as I can I love to see other people have these breakthroughs these aha moments when they realize that hey they had successes they've had more successes than they think they've had and be whatever seems like a daunting challenge today you can really you can look back on the tools you use for past excesses look at the resources you have around you look at your community look at your colleagues look at people in your mastermind and and take those some of those tools apply them to your challenges today and you can make those breakthroughs and I love helping people get through those breakthroughs was a little more selfish and not alive so I was to define success by a nation it would

whether the podcast social media videos physical products you name it and that's why love is the freedom to be able to do that to make that choice so what is success to you answer that question and I feel free to email <Music/Noise> O Fire dot com David what's the one thing that you are most excited about today I think that the Internet and technology has made it easier for the lines to blur between employment and entrepreneurship and between being a leader and being a follower if you look at leadership the way it worked a generation ago was primarily command and control we know that doesn't work anymore so there's a lot of ways that people can become leaders and a lot of ways people can move forward with entrepreneurship and the other hand that's also made it more complicated and often more challenging to be a great entrepreneur and a great leader and the things I most fired up about today is when I see people that take the time to have live face to face interactions because the technology that we have has made it less common for people to have face to face interaction and when I see people put all their gadgets down and spend time really focusing on <Music/Noise> powerful results happen so to fire nation in the world that we live in now has a meeting of G to break down these ease barriers <Music/Noise> is is no other time in grade fifty years ago you entered a

shockingly and <Music/Noise> you are in Episode one hundred and fourteen <Music/Noise> to the intro that episode and I was hysterical as far as like I was clueless you were still great in your <Music/Noise> you are so good then we had you back on it like it was a hundred episodes <Music/Noise> was too bad it was a long gap <Music/Noise> then eleven <Music/Noise> five then twelve forty seven and then fourteen seventy one season we kind of picked it up there and now it's seventeen twenty three so I think my niece's little confused about who's actually the host of your fire right now I think we've all gone from mediocrity to greatness now since I was a very old school once the COC God knows what's going on back to our little E knows there's a guy knows was going on I sure do now and I don't want to it's cringe worthy but Fire Nation David if you don't know yet is the creator of the rise to the topic and create awesome online courses helps people create and <Music/Noise> courses with thousands of students in over a hundred countries of all create a successful courses on everything from kindergarten teaching to snowboarding a lot of cool things we talking about later but even before we move onto other meats of this interview kind of filling some gaps in the snow was going on recently made father yet the Father times to know what <Music/Noise> I was coming I saw the boy and the girl you know I know everything is great here I mean it's funny because after discovering the world of online courses now got so many years on that now was like two thousand and ten two thousand eleven which in Internet years is like fourteen eighty three I write it's you watch this it's very funny cuz one of the big things for any business model or adding something to your business or go into a new business or whatever you're doing right is you have to have many good reasons wanna do it and it's funny because you know with courses are taught more about this but you know you get a lot of leverage to get a lot of time back in your business they would have a lot other very hands on business models where you're there every day right and it's funny as you start to his life changes like when I first started my course I wasn't I wasn't married yet right now I'm married and then years later now a cannon and other Can you say and your time gets more and more precious and different and it's just amazing that I know that I've got the backing of this business model that's what I always try to impart on other people as well it's not just about the amazing money in and helping people get results because that's what it's all about for sure are right but it's also about kind of taking control of your own business and so for me I get excited like no other kids coming oh great is that the system as couple of things in the business we're going to go you go you know we've got stuff that are running twenty four seven without me necessarily being there on and that's when the beauties of this so everything is fantastic career for sure one fire now did everytime I talk to Mike finally I get to talk to the person who's literally <Music/Noise> excited and enthusiastic to be a microphone as I am because Unitarian through the seventies weekend you know sometimes these people that get on the mike and they're just like Yeah <Music/Noise> like listen I need to just inject some fire fluid is you because you know that's actually why I would start every episode with Are you prepared to ignite because I want them to know that my ridiculous so they better get to my level or in now forget about Albion interrupting cow I five someone on the way out of Starbucks today just a random verse I was a high five and has walked away and I don't know what that person figuring out but

talk about how you are the average of the fi piece for the most time with you need to spend time with people that are signing up for these web in our period because they're the people you need to hang out with now she fired up because again this is happening on July thirteenth is two p m Eastern and we'll talk about these luscious die as to the benefits of horses yeah this is such a great topic as a lot of time for yourself why should you this right so if you're if you're listening Fire Nation which Meyer here and listen to jail the analyst Ray Cason you know you have a business some kind or thinking about starting one right out of pod casters here maybe you're in jail these podcast Paradise program on the biggest aspiring author speaker coach consultant all different things out there I'm just a quick contacts yet the mushy closing and just on a personal note here of kind of shoe milestones one is just about to crack seven million dollars in sales online courses come I'm super excited about and by the way before anyone likes to call out and say even if you teach courses on course is yes I do but I started the first several million were in completely other topic so so very important point that out on also we're getting close to nearly four thousand people in the summer courses program that I have and now which I loved this gives context for this we now have what we're calling a seven figure and a six figure club that start to fill up with people that have made seven figures with their online course and six figures with their online course and we now <Music/Noise> keys were getting several we have at least tentative cross of a seven figure mark recently likened this year yak on and we've gotten many more concerts have an exciting thing is teacher which kind of brings me the first benefit on and this is something that's so important and you'll notice right away when I talk about this job it is important that we're not talking about like some sketchy internet marketing we're talking offline about this about some new stuff online and you need change and want to say that sack now never do that right so my point of this so the first benefit is that online courses are the ultimate scalable way to help people get results and have a big impact right so think about that for second because the most successful online course traders come from a place of not only to have a great business of course but getting people results that put on my course is all about your job is of course creator is to get people from point A to Point B create change or transformation right at the most successful ones they come from that place that's what they're passionate about because you can only help people one <Music/Noise> much I know she'll be used to consulting ICU consulting don't do anymore right there's only so many people that you can help me doing one <Music/Noise> and there's only so many hours and at right so online courses offer a syllable way to have people get big results and in my opinion and this isn't just my pain is really fast on if you really want someone to take a transformation from point A to Point B entered into a product courses are the vehicle gay they're on no if ands or buts about that in fact I'm not going to poke fun of anyone even read it's really tempting it's not like I'm holding back there to pitch like ropes holding me back like I'm trying not to but there's some people out there some people out there that teach other business mouse is not a thing wrong with these business models but other types of business we can take your expertise or knowledge experience and turn into a product that's not of course but guess how they teach in jail they how the course re integrate irony of this world like me because the bottom line here is the courses are the top vehicle for teaching in transformation lines was the ultimate skill way to get people to get results on and that is the number one thing I want to talk tantrums benefits but we've got several more jail day for sure I'm excited <Music/Noise> this I knew the answer that question but <Music/Noise> I was playing the vibe was playing the violin to give <Music/Noise> a kindly played tennis I love it but I need to be for beginners to some other things are super important I mean you you had already fired com slash course or to register for this free master class you've been talking about wanting freedom and mash the general human holding off for some reason well freedom in mastery journals are literally going to be raining upon your head if you make it to this free master class lor see exactly why <Music/Noise> there's been over twenty four thousand feet and gentle soul I write next and what a perfect accompaniments I said that were perfectly accompaniments to crying of course using the freedom to create a course and the National <Music/Noise> thousand sales and this is a package deal by the way so there's just a ton of reasons to be there for all these things in D C What is another benefit it's funny because you don't even know it the second benefit was but has exactly what I like what you just mentioned is that it's actually about freedom right and it's to create a freedom based business now let's stop here let's pump the cliches let's not get high on Facebook with a rented Lamborghini pointing and saying you know in just one minute a day I got the celebrity right that is now what this is all about because I feel like this is honestly the most cliche things we hear about online it's like there's a pictures of people with laptops and beaches why the heck would you have your laptop at the beach by the way gets and the mass and also if you have a laptop to beat your freaking working at the beach which is good doesn't sound much fun I want to get an ocean swim around right so this is a very important thing a lot of us and if you win this vote to get into a business a lot of different reasons write like you want to make money on nope maybe have impact or or all the things and help people right but a lot of times you want freedom and you get the opposite effect in your business I was like that raining so I started out like this to be great if I could have my own schedule and do what I want when I wanted to talk about doing no work that's how I'm talking I'm talking about like actual like work when I want to I want to call every Tuesday Taco Tuesdays and I were just goes for twenty four hours you do that right that happening with me is I kind of became a slave to my own business right I had these big sponsors I was doing a podcast which you do be doing much better job of it we have five I was doing speaking I was doing consulting is always different things and I was working twenty four seven so now going vacation I would be yelled at by my wife basically twenty four seven as well because I had trouble unplugging and kind of on system I see something well with course is the creative freedom based business right you can make the rules the way they want because you're creating an asset you're creating a product you're selling a product is you in product form right on so when you do that you get to make the rules so like for me freedom is going to gym everyday until the day for two hours or not missing anything of my daughter's frantically happens you've got little events and she was at Hugo's turtle two year old gymnasts are huge but whatever as you know that's for me yours is whatever you want to be and I think that's another big benefit because just because we have an internet based business doesn't mean we have freedom a lot of times I know way too many people that have an internet based business that the computer twenty four seven like what's the fun in that so it's not that there's no work involved of course there's work and it's fun work but with horses you do you have the opportunity to create whatever the heck schedule you want and do it on your terms and a lot of you can also be automated as well I mean it has about the pop offer the same because foundation I just love <Music/Noise> we throw these master classes in as I get emails you know six months a year sometimes even six hours after you jump in one of these programs <Music/Noise> like John this is what <Music/Noise> to take freedom back into my life and to go on those vacations and actually prioritize me in my family and my health and my nutrition my fitness like this is where you why you're taking your life back and we have <Music/Noise> many value bombs that are coming your way right after we thank our sponsors looking to own <Music/Noise> maybe it's time to look into becoming an Allstate agency owner as an AG <Music/Noise> not just selling insurance policies you're building equity in the business with the opportunity to pass it down or someday sell the more than just an agent be an Allstate agency owner visits Allstate agent dot com slash he'll fire to learn more today subject to the terms of the agency agreements successful launch viewers know <Music/Noise> and accomplish goals those <Music/Noise> simply do not I have created a step by step guide for you to set your number <Music/Noise> and accomplish that goal in one hundred days allow me to introduce the freedom <Music/Noise> with over seventeen thousand sold to date the fee in general is the world's Number <Music/Noise> journal that will guide you in accomplishing <Music/Noise> and one hundred days with daily tasks daily recaps ten day sprint in quarterly <Music/Noise> you'll knock or that one big domino by day one hundred and begin a chain reaction of awsome to learn more visit the Freedom <Music/Noise> dock on Sunday she wore back and this is a couple things one run to real quick before I hand over to you for another benefits of <Music/Noise> is Number one Fire Nation five seekers to a successful online course this is a free master class and ESU myself are dropping for you this Thursday July thirteenth at two p m Eastern all you do is head over to heel Fire dot com slash course sign up you get a hysterical thank you video there's a huge gift there the dishes didn't <Music/Noise> yet he ends the freedom and mastery journals are literally be dropping on your heads during this training I'm going to be putting this back together this free international pack for everybody that comes in takes action at this master class so just wait the guys <Music/Noise> at your door soon after to the smashed glass and take action because that's what I want I want you to not just you know have a good two thousand seventy Lakeside to have an on fire two thousand seventeen the last thing I really <Music/Noise> is I L T is in vast learn and teach like you invest in yourself all the time fire nation through times like right now was into this you learn the contents like we're teaching today now it's time to turn around and teach in that's what this master classes can help you do have finally figured out that final T was his turn around and teach so David take away rather wacko all of that as well and that thing is also supporting know like there's a lot of trainees out there but I see I've got a team of spies it seems like every single training I love the lines <Music/Noise> Alpine you trust will find you everywhere but the thing is like they've seen and this is just unfortunate it comes with the territory right on is there's a lot of very bad advice out there on there's advice because of people that maybe they made their intentions are good like me don't have enough experience with and are maybe that they just teach in a way that was too unique to them unlike other people can relate to it right on and for me that's very important to note that when we talk about the secrets on that rainy it's not only what I've done to go from zero to now close to seven million dollars in sales of online courses but now nearly four thousand students served on a cross a border every different type of topic with every type of demographic and every type of background the boss imagined so it's it's based on that as well on so we were talking about benefits of course is that there's a lot of them but I think it's really cool is that upfront work get paid for years ok so now let's see are different as a spa like you're doing coaching are speaking great super fine right but every time you have to speak it to get on stage and speak right every time that you need to coax someone to go down there and do it over and over again there's nothing that yes you get do the same coaching yes you disdain speech over and over again but not creating a product not really an asset that you can sell on how the course you put in effort and then your online course is an asset to be sold again and again and again for years and years and years I mean even selling podcast paradise and Weber on fire for how many years that for years <Music/Noise> real quick I have made it very <Music/Noise> small of these to those I mean every time I need to make an update I do with all the time reinventing the wheel every couple months Fire Nation I created <Music/Noise> product I update the views of the updating <Music/Noise> but beyond that is just that initial investment that we needed right exactly because unlike a ounce looking for random things I in my office like this calendar <Music/Noise> ok let's say that this calendar and I sell a thousand calendars jelly and i realise i miss spelled July the calendar will be in big trouble or a liking to have a recall say it's like you know cars getting recalls up like that it's not so with all my courses because Allie creating a product an asset but something changes you want to make an update on you know some customers come and say Oh you know maybe this can be explained all the better you certainly have the easy option to flip on the camera right record a little update and pop it up there and that's another cool thing you have like a living breathing product and you don't have to redo from scratch like I can tell you how many students that we have on that continue to sell the same course is over and over again for three four and in some cases five years and even more on because you're creating a product that can continually be fresh and to go to a new audience we're very excited how long is part of life only Brown by Jeff Locke Grammy's a great guy but I mean that's been around for like twelve years <Music/Noise> eleven years this year's insane and in real quick is the story away you're talking about because the physical products this is true and this is scary I was going to print literally I was going to print for thirty thousand of the mastery journals was going to print like it was it was it was already <Music/Noise> I paid it was going to prance that day that was <Music/Noise> to start running through the machines <Music/Noise> got a letter and they said hey you can't call it self mastery journalists <Music/Noise> of itself nasty joke is there some stupid comedy out there they had some rice on the where self or something and I bought smile or he's like enforcing this is Kyla Jets what do you do and I was like shh was just in time so I like the ones of the mast regional dot com is available he said that that was clear so we printed thirtieth thousands of them were Street Journal I mean what's come on in. That's not <Music/Noise> courses just sayin' I'm sweating right now thinking about ideas she actually starts sliding over the course is to get change to ask and you can change it has something to his blatant self over and over and over again that super exciting and one more on that till the end I think this is another key benefit gala forget this one is was like I do not forget is on my last and I was like I got this call I forgot very upset about this we have to bring me back for my you know three hundred ninth time is and this is this is another one is not often talked about but it's very very important is that you don't need a huge amount of buyers to be successful with an online course ok so a lot of people have this illusion that you need to have ten thousand buyers are thousands of buyers to be successful with it ok now what's nice about online courses is a seller of premium say compared to any book or something like that right when you're teaching someone something so I <Music/Noise> map and geez I hope this is right eye by rascals are like them I can enter a town in CA I run out while the I eighty three calculator still makes fun out there but if you gets one buyer a day in tact for a course that sells for four hundred and ninety seven dollars Okay hundred and eighty one thousandfour hundred and five dollars a year hopefully I and when you think about that in perspective I mean if you're telling people I get ten thousand by Rs five thousand by Rs three thousand mice make it a success that can be a little bit intimidating regular Benton Harbor When I watch my first course on which is about doing online <Music/Noise> that's what I was doing at the time that for five years call me awesome interviews we only had four people that are marketed to in the very first launch jail they ended nineteen thousand eight hundred dollars in sales now that course is John did well over a quarter million much more and I was gone from air but only think that you know you have to have these thousands of eyes to be successful and what's nice about that is because courses sell for premium prices right compared to something a very low price of something very very low the dollar ninety nine or something like that right whatever is on us to get a huge amount of buyers to break six figures or seven figures with an online course not necessarily true at all you could run the math on that it's less than a buyer a day for ninety seven far last on to get you six figures you need <Music/Noise> thousand buyers for today on course yeah that's that's just the thought of that

worst moments his aha moment he crossed the lightning rounds of your lists and all that jazz is a good story as a good journey go back and listen to Episode thirteen hundred and eighty five but today we talking about reviews testimonials all that jazz <Music/Noise> really being a master class from Doran on is how you can make your business better for the services that his company provides an NYPD focus on certain things he might not be so just take it off with why should we even bother getting reviews and testimonials I think it goes without saying <Music/Noise> you look at a restaurant and a new location you not just going to roll a dice most people are going to pull up their smartphone going to bust out Yelp or go and they're going to do a search for local restaurants in is <Music/Noise> the best reviews we do that for restaurants we do it for resorts we do it for all kinds of products and services heck my sign because it is Big Dog Daddy forgot his teddy bear in the airplane I forgot it under the seat he was so perturbed and disturbed he was so upset with Daddy and then shes like ok I need a new teddy bear what did he do his five years old the time he sort of looking on Google and looking at reviews for teddy bears so it just goes to show yeah people really lean on reviews we want to avoid eleven we want to avoid the mistakes we regret not just for ourselves but also for the implications ramifications that that decision might make on friends or family members and sixty one percent of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase decision by get this seventy nine percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation from a friend or family member that was eight to ten people deem online reviews is just as influential in their buying decision making process as a recommendation from a friend or family member that's significant influence and that's why reviews <Music/Noise> critical would say right now I think reviews are mission critical I mean I really <Music/Noise> my time I think my time is very valuable but every single day Fire Nation I'm in the fifth in the field journal and in that original Facebook group this is private a spoof or just people have those journals we have great conversations <Music/Noise> with something new pops in and they say Oh my God I am <Music/Noise> the freedom or the <Music/Noise> or for any reason I take my time and I individually <Music/Noise> that person I say listen thank you Kathy Jo or Tom or Sarah thank you for commenting and it's in ensuring those kind words in the Facebook group I really appreciate that if you are my I really appreciate <Music/Noise> by their rules love <Music/Noise> because it just sounds so much and they give <Music/Noise> right there and one <Music/Noise> on one fine Asian I do that one on one and do that individually every single day I've done hundreds of those messages over the past few weeks I have over three hundred and forty five Star reviews for the field journal and the matches are always just got on Amazon a couple weeks ago already has forty and that sold me for my biz competitors have twelve sixteen is some of them <Music/Noise> three and a half stars of total rain breaking because they've been getting good and bad ones because Evan asking their best customers and clients for the good one so this is very valuable people make buying decisions every day on the scene just like the one was saying I don't know what I do share which was a tactic and a tool that works very effectively what are some other ways to get reviews on other ways what you're doing you know through manual human effort and let's face it it works perfect case in point that it works however if you want to really pour gasoline on the fire we want a system that works well we're not working so ideally we would have a system that ass for the review after certain amount of time I call it the MMS the moment of maximum satisfaction that's when you want to ask not when you haven't filled your promises but after you fulfill the promise of going experience of you that delightful in their jacked induced about the value they received there's usually <Music/Noise> moment that intuitively the best time to ask for the review so for you might be a certain period of time after they've gotten into your stuff answer to consumer stuff and good value for my stuff then we want to send him a text or an email or both and ask for the reviews so we need that trigger point and then when a system that submits the ask and then here's the big mistake a lot of people make in entrepreneurial realm as they go directly for the juggler and they ask for a view directly on <Music/Noise> site now I'm not pointing any fingers because it still works right but ideally we want to give the multiple auctions because here's the thing about getting reviews on Google <Music/Noise> or TripAdvisor <Music/Noise> of these places Amazon for that matter you need an account in order to give a review if you don't have an account you have to go through the hassle of creating one just to submit a review and that's why <Music/Noise> a hundred people for review typically only get five ten fifteen percent to use that request because they don't have an account and they love you but they don't love me enough to do those activities to some interview right so what we want to do is we want to ask for the review and give the system by which they can give you the review with out needing an account I caught a revue capture page to want to send him to a page where they can submit their name their email address how many stars are going to give you based on their sentiment five being the best and one <Music/Noise> level of satisfaction and a place where they can submit a tech space testimonial and then underneath that we want consent so they're giving you consent to use that reviewing your marketing and then a cement bond that's the anatomy of a killer effective review capture page and the beautiful thing about that is if they don't require an account you can get a much higher conversion of fun since the beginning five ten percent you can get twenty twenty five thirty forty percent plus and I and then on the Thank You page that's where we asked them to copy and paste on these different review sites unless it's negative it is a negative review we're going to do damage control we're going to quarantine at work in a firewall that thing so that the negativity that negativity doesn't spew on the web tarnishing the reputation online instead we get feedback from the client on how to improve but it's not spewing onto the web it's not spewing on to Google or Yelp or any of these review sites so it's quarantined is kept private and if it's positive that's where we ask them to share with the world and shared on these review sites like Amazon like Google like Yelp and any review site the strategic to your business doesn't make sense it makes sense for me and I can have a question about the wording so flashy that absolutely I think we can go about this kind of asking everybody that speaking kind of highly about its product or service or community for review that's a good tactic for sharing with that process that you just talked about the one that I didn't know is having a couple times that out as somebody uh thanks for your kind words of this is all the feet and runs great and <Music/Noise> it and then they would go ahead <Music/Noise> like a four or five star sia four or three star review <Music/Noise> like Oh it's was really good I like it but you know <Music/Noise> fallen yet because they're just like we can or you know maybe they just think it's worth four stars whatever so that really hurts we <Music/Noise> that four star believe it or not a lot of people don't even recognize it that really hurt and you're really going for that just as all filled out fight to get that glance at only one that fits ours only half filled and which is now the field right now that's as a little bit of a red flag for duty for that will there's a <Music/Noise> is not all the way to five like he was <Music/Noise> Five ghosts are so this is now what I do door and I would love your feedback on this I know actually when ness is these people actually say if you think is deserving of five stars would you take a minute to go in to rate <Music/Noise> the fields <Music/Noise> Here's the link some kind of precursor by saying hey if you think is earning a five stars so me very clear if they think is deserving then take the step where your thoughts on that I think it's a good step to take if you're sending them directly to one place like Amazon because then your pre screening numb and you're set you're planting the seed that you're expecting and wanting five stars so it's a conditional ask right so that makes sense in that case however if your rest restaurant for example hypothetically speaking and you're wanting more reviews for your restaurant you might hand out a little card with every bill passed by your servers this is how did we do please review us and get a chance to win acts like a hundred dollar gift certificate or some like that and then they go to your review capture page and instead assume them to Google or TripAdvisor or Yelp you're just getting the review first if it's negative who cares it's quarantined anyways and so now you have that feedback so it allows the system to give you transparency <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> your team is actually doing so instead of just getting people to blow hot air up your butt every day and just get positive feedback all day long why not get constructive feedback that's less than affirming but allows you to improve your policies procedures protocol and you know it's no skin off your back because its quarantine is kept private is just for internal use and then if it's positive instead of just pigeon holing them to one platform that they may <Music/Noise> have an account for we want to give them multiple options give them a menu Google Yelp TripAdvisor et-cetera Facebook and then they'll choose the one they have an account for him because given the multiple options are more likely to do something as opposed to nothing makes sense fire Nation that makes a lot of sense and healing Dorn has been dropping in value <Music/Noise> thus far this week we get back from taking our sponsors building establishing <Music/Noise> not easy if you know I design person that can be frustrating time consuming and extremely expensive to get great design work done that's why <Music/Noise> design crowd rather than paying expensive fees waiting weeks for a seat a patient ID or create a great looking logo for you you could

to learn more visit the Freedom <Music/Noise> dock on the door back and use these words a few times quarantined fire wall that you kind of brush the surface of how to best him in the reviews blissfully dive deep now how do we handle negative reviews the best possible way it's a great question and there's a study done where they found that seven out of ten consumers or customers will return to a business if their complaint is resolved quickly swiftly are quickly sewed speed is the name of the game so what that means is if we can have a feedback system by which to learn about any complaints that come and and and be all over it like white on <Music/Noise> said in a SWAT team to rectify the situation ASAP it dramatically improves the chances that they will come back that they will patronize you in the future that they will send you referrals of friends and family members so speed is really the name of the game and that's why having a feedback loop that makes a transparent his sole mission critical and you want to be able to have that system notify you immediately by text and or email the moment any complaints come in and that's why the testimonial <Music/Noise> reasons why the testimonial and so powerful is because it does up for you and your not only abreast of any negative feedback but positive feedback and let's face it John when you have an avalanche of positive praise come into your inbox is pretty hard to have a bad day no need for Prozac that right that's a good day so that's why having feedback on the positive and negative is so important he can stay on top of things you can affirm people when they're doing well and you can correct things when things aren't working as well as you'd like so is willing to get to good reviews <Music/Noise> as we get great reviews but then how do you actually use those reviews to get more referrals there is very loose terminology that can be interpreted different ways <Music/Noise> to refer all most people think of referral as a referral from a friend or referral from a colleague in that sort of thing you know one on one more serendipitous in nature and racially based based on people we know however now that we're in this digital age the referral idea can extend to these online review sites for example I have a client who gets two to four deals a month at three G's a pop in the mortgage business from Google every month because he's got oodles an oodles of rave reviews on his Google my business account people do online search and they see him come up in the three pack on the map right with that mouth with the with the flags he's right in there in the three pack the top three listings and he's got hands down way more reviews than any of his competitors so its clients calling him up saying hey we did our research we got awesome reputation great reviews we decided to hire you what's next pre cooked pre ten arise pre sold pre disposed to buy hot for what he's got there a slam dunk he gets four of those closed at least typically every month ok so that is a Google referrals far as I'm concerned but we don't stop there we also want to ask for referrals from our raving fans think about it who better to give us referrals and someone is give us a five star review I mean that's a raving fan right so what we want to do is launch a dedicated referral attraction campaign to our raving fans you've got a compilation of people giving you four or five stars by the way for stars aim by ad that makes five stars all the more believable I know perfection is hated because it's not five but it makes the fives more believable because it's like Superman <Music/Noise> wouldn't be as compelling enough trip tonight you get a little imperfection in there so nothing wrong with a four star so for stars above you compile lists those are called your raving fans right and now we launch a campaign and so for example you can send out a magic wand letter that's right we call it the magic one letter and it's got a toy magic wand and clothes in the headlines as I wish I wish poof get more clients like you know it's cheesy as hell but it works with more cheese in your wallet and the big idea there is that the client is awesome you should have other awesome clients just like them and perhaps they could miss make your wish come true by Cindy referrals I had a client who use that with his clients he said all fifty letters he generated six referrals he made eighteen G's in revenue cost him two hundred box Jose Ferraro why I like that are why I think this was the call positive I <Music/Noise> absolutely adore what <Music/Noise> is in today on fire so give us the partying at Pisa guidance you know how we can really take advantage of all of this awesomeness you know specifically what you're offering me how we can get a little test drive then the best league in disconnect with what you have going <Music/Noise> add them was taken by swill thanks again for me on one of the best ways for people to get the stuff and to help execute what we talked about today is to get systems that work while you're not working and so I put together a really cool package called the ultimate testimonial toolkit it's got checklists for getting testimonials and reviews in terms of what to do how to do it how to avoid mistakes it's got template swipe and employ proven template for asking for reviews for

nights yes full bless <Music/Noise> her is the founder and CEO of Wonder e aid network of storytellers one degrees podcast include sorta scale Hollywood in crime we study billionaires fall of Rome and their leaders hits I hate my boss before that Hurd was <Music/Noise> of Fox International channels a three billion dollar organization how do we get there after moving to the U S at twenty seven speaking broken English we're about to find out it's taken me to fill some gaps from that and shown give us a little glimpse of your personal life I'm here Los Angeles with my family took a It's spend a lot of time outdoors and alone time workin and one of the things that really got me excited about moving to the ass I grew up in Argentina and I had always looked out of the US some plays where you couldn't really get ahead by being the best in you can be whatever you are doing and he doesn't was and <Music/Noise> related to how many connections that who you <Music/Noise> went to school although of course these things matter and do matter but I always was attracted to this idea that in the US if you really dedicate yourself to what areas you want to do you can make it wow love that's love it's in her and what you say your area of expertise is just a couple sentences I be believer in reading people in the power of reading people getting to know them to indeed listening reading body language understanding people because that will help you in life and they'll help you in business I had a big moment when I was in my late twenties early thirties when I was working on FOX and a lot of people were coming to the petition please potential customers people I want to sell me stuff as I'm sure happens to you all the time and just how much time you spend with it the evil doubt will be a net positive versus negative in your life can have a huge influence on whether you make progress or you're always stuck in neutral and I think that's a lesson that any person especially entrepreneurs can take her in what is something that we don't <Music/Noise> reading people is on for years we probably should for instance there is a number of behavior said that the people that appear to be great on paper especially the people when you made them for the first time they're super exciting new find and other funny and they always have the right answer and they always make you laugh on their char Maine and then you start to scratch a little under the surface and you find that there's no there there most of us because of the primacy by as the primacy of eyes is just ugh you are me you can really remember the first impression that he get our sons were something or or somebody in our truck to the first version and it takes a long time to realize they may be that great person that we did for us is a bully or a used car salesman or antisocial and the negative energy that you spend getting rid of my razor she can bike the other hairs of your life so I'll recommend a look and there's actually a book that I read many years ago that talking about this whole emotional vampires that should be required reading for anybody starting a business or anybody quite frankly that he's still working for a company Fire Nation another area of her his expertise is storytelling he's a great storyteller and in fact this coming August at podcast them he's going be telling a pretty cool presentation giving a great presentation on storytelling in the dark I mean we're going to have the lights off his Jedi Knight masks he can really get the power of the story the power of audio so if you're in L A area in August me she gets a podcast whom I'll be there Kate of course since her knees maybe there was some other great people so deftly check it out now her and speak the stories I want to get into your journey as an entrepreneur <Music/Noise> of it with the Argentina thing but give us specifically what you consider your worst entrepreneurial <Music/Noise> during that <Music/Noise> and Hearn and leisure dive and take us to that moment in time tells the story remember only beat into butter for about a year and change has spent nineteen years on Fox being a corporate on Kubrick second I know that sounds horrible war I feel I was little where you could use a Youth Incorporated I was like oh you know I like the dream it'll be done for him for like nine out of the nineteen years I was there ten years I was relieved just fantasizing that want to be free on how my own business little do you know that we see when you have your own basis yes you get freedom in all respects but you never have complete freedom but I much rather be in for an error and ten thousand on the stone yet but the eye I think the worse moment that I had in my mind for dear life I nanny was an eye a big mistake or even not always see a fox so was making deals and going <Music/Noise> wall Daniel talking to people in tens of millions and hundreds of millions and we would spend twenty five grand before breakfast on the We will take out the teen for bonding all site and they'll be fifty grand so I come to podcasting it's only too happy and why do you give up TV for podcasts in and tell them you realize I actually gave up working for somebody else for Kramer Company podcast in the sun then deeply passionate about but after the ninety four for mines fine minds I'm not particularly patient person we got our first ever tie seen deal and he was twenty five thousand dollars and when I compare what you how much I would not be how long in time to go before I get excited with twenty five thousand dollars to what I was really excited by getting twenty five thousand dollars said alright well this is going to be a little more difficult than a guy thought and then the second deal the week I mean that we bring in his order to cease ten thousand dollars So at some point I'm really starting to question what is this a wise move I mean I could go into any other company to another version of what I was doing <Music/Noise> rough miles and then the bill money starts to kick in and and then before you know we were making six figure <Music/Noise> over have a million dollars a month in revenue by I gotta tell you that the moment where we got the second advertising the lead once more in the first one that to me Mom fell that we were going to fail I'm glad I I marched on that is one Dri have other <Music/Noise> beyond sponsorships we have licensing agreements so we'll trade show for the graphical locked Up abroad and we sold the rights to tune in A on all audio platform and after the other Susan we know we will release in more broadly now we want to make sure our <Music/Noise> gets what <Music/Noise> to make sure that we understand about the difficult and you had going from twenty five k which is always tough to get to the now is done it's handy like on <Music/Noise> direction we want to make sure our listeners gets from that story I think our listeners your leaders need to understand that progress is never lean year you think that you go from point A to B to say but sometimes you have to go in a different direction you have to take one step back in order to go one step for the only thing that you need to make sure that you do is that you take every sat by as a learning opportunity and make sure that you'd earned the right lessons from it Kingman jump around a little bit back to kind of my previous question on a follow up with the you have any other revenue streams are looking to open up the down the <Music/Noise> you just kind of focus on the sponsorships and licensing right now we are going to open up costs or revenue stream us well we'll we'll give our listeners the opportunity to directly contribute to the shows we haven't done that yet but some of our shows have been doing before the joint laundry and we are now going to do that for most of our shelves one odd moment her new name may be seen to be the mommy decided to open wondering or whatever that may be but take us to one of the greatest ideas you've had to date as an ox when you are and again really dive in and tell us that story that moment happened and how you turned it into a success I was trying to dig cold was so special of the serial podcast everybody had been listening to everyone <Music/Noise> to decipher the secret sauce behind it and one day Alice to work at Fox I flew back on a long flight and I mean just listen to for episodes one after the other gods soloing gross with a story so immersed in the story and there realize that when you listen to this to a story like cereal the more time you spend with the more emotionally invested your in the character's hand he'd hit me that television has been going through the same thing so low you have these procedural show so you can watch Juan and Ms three and and or sitcoms and then in two thousand one evil Laos people really gives people the ability to watch TV shows on their own time in a sequence from beginning to end and that's the you know you how The Sopranos on the wire and Game of Thrones on Breaking Bad so these so called Golden Age of Television was born change in technology the same things happening park I seem to think about the history off already alright that the Off Off talk all you non musical audio Howard Stern el V's any DJ any talk radio personality was grading their shows to grace a soul thinking that people may not be able to join a ten minutes or twenty or thirty and then leave out any one time so that the commercial that they make a tasty sign for the listening experience to show that you make Joan requires people to listen with attention from beginning to end the Serie A last holler in crime so the humble man was of this change in technology justly have been in television is going to change not only the way people listen to audio by the kind of ordeal shows are made and I want to be the forefront of creating those kind of all the shows and their local town council wisely and that somehow wonder he was born so cool I just love Fire Nation what happens when he was a step back and think that something that was so few of us do in this world enough you know we just go from activity to activity were O P A other people's agendas all day long what hurt India he said You know what sucks is going on with cereal he got a plane was in the four episodes he just thought like he does let the wheels span he figured out what was special about that you can do that in your industry in your passions fire nations give yourself the chance to do just that now her and give us the one take away the you want to make sure our listeners gets from that greatest idea you had today you always need to look back in history recent history all history and he always going to find one paralleled us for a line and that parallel ones you find in will give you the opportunity to be to be an industry the early stage of the vote only for too many people coming in before it's too late her new <Music/Noise> of exciting things going on a lot <Music/Noise> that are doing <Music/Noise> well and has a ton in the pipeline <Music/Noise> pretty cool what do you know just fired up about right now what do you think his name one thing what are you excited about this show which is logical I hate my body I think you're going to interview the <Music/Noise> couple weeks is so fascinating because you know if you ever listen to Love Line or the insurer or Dave Ramsey's older so many of my shows about relationships and money and real estate even there's never been a big shawl outdoor play and yet we spend so much time where we spent eight hours that year people total on my work wife for people to my best work friends by you you never know where we are prone to somebody at war and you don't know which will ask for advice because again as other people in the office because they may have a stake in the matter and he can ask your loved ones because they really know they're running the trains with you so we created these concepts in where the stone whose former Seymour used were with me and on Fox before that she was a Nike and she's a podcast or herself an author Larry See Lek an executive coach who asked either from Google and easy and small startups and as if they mean and they take the listener questions and the The show includes a comedy

most inspiring art you are safe and easy week and if you are ready to mash up for it to be disciplined in focus in one hundred days you must visit the mastery Journal dot com Now show today's featured guest Kathleen liquor s Kathleen are you prepared to eat bites absolutely let's do that Kathleen has held the thousands of health and fitness professionals around the world transform their business out of Orwell and generate <Music/Noise> for customizable coaching programs are used by health coaches fitness trainers and other wellness professionals to empower them to change lies on a global scale Kathleen take a minute to fill some gaps from that and shown give us a little glimpse your personal life that's how I live in San Diego with my husband and cats I have two teenagers though they do keep me pretty busy that about four years ago I became certified as a health coach and I sort of fumbled my way through things the bed with out trying to figure out the most efficient way to see clients and run my business and one of my main goals was always to have a schedule with a total flexibility because I wanted to be all my kids' events and school activities so I structured my business around that but when I started out I knew very little bike next to nothing really about on line marketing size as I was working to grow my business I was taking courses reading books The Thing a podcast like yours Johnny and I work for the couple of business coaches so I could make progress faster and avoid as many mistakes as possible so and you know when I look back I realize that it's pretty amazing how much you can learn to implement for years but at the time a kind of feels like you're going at snail's pace that's one thing I think he was a little big struggle with Kathleen is they don't really understand that slate age concept of the compound of fact where they get into the little things right everyday I mean that's the truth in business thus the truth in fitness test of truth in nutrition to wake up tomorrow be like Oh my God I look so great of a six pack in my skin is glowing you wake up a look at the mere six months later at doing the right things every single day so jus realise Fire Nation to the right things be accountable to that changes will occur now Kathleen what is your area of expertise just break down a couple sentences I tell my area of expertise is creating white label copyright free coaching programs the health and most professionals can use to help them feel more confidence and help their clients get great results so basically I do for them when they would do for themselves if they have the time in the experience and the knowledge which they probably don't have an Intel and the funny thing as I didn't find this area of expertise until I was almost fifty years old so it's never too late to start something new especially as an entrepreneur you know I always say that I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up and tell him not to listen sometimes you're going to take that long to figure out fine as you need experience you need time uni failures into successes to make things happen now within that area of expertise Kathleen and I love how you put that I was very clear very concise what is something that we don't know is on from yours that we probably should add I think part for any entrepreneur that wants to build a business is setting themselves up for success by choosing the tools and systems that they feel comfortable using in their business because feeling overwhelmed is a huge stumbling block to getting yourself out there and making prayer a sale I really think the key is to start simple like all caps simple Don't compare yourself to people that have been at this for years you know like people I have a like a five part video series for a lead nagged that they're running Evergreen webinars that got this intricate membership site things like that and I think if you are a health coach or fitness professional or any type of coach to really start with working with one and one people then move to adding something like an online program if if that's what you want to deal or if your brand you to creating elite magnet to carry or email lets start with something like a simple two to three page guide or like a cheat sheet in a don't don't over complicate things just because you see other people doing it doesn't mean you have to do it too and I'll share one perfect example of this that happened to me and this is how all this is how I know this cake and we all are from our mistakes right after I had worked with a few one on one coaching clients I launched an on line group coaching program and I didn't start out simple I thought they needed a little this uber cool learning management system and it took a lot of time energy to get them into place and guess what and the members Fayyad they would really just prefer to receive the content via e mail rather than having to lock into a membership site and I was like Really so that was a huge major lightbulb moment like I was the one that was hung up on the bells and whistles and not the people there are paying me for the program so I know it's it's too easy to go down the attack black hole in and have never lined team because there's too many dang options right and it can be confusing say you stay stuck and you don't do anything though im a time you can just launch a program with something as simple as e mail and then using Dropbox Google docs or Amazon s three and a face the group in an Iran as a beta group test things and then add more later sell I think is Keep It Simple say you can get started in by the way if a nation I'm even go one step further say that's how you'd need it to launch because that's what you <Music/Noise> what your clients or customers want until you have clients and customers will launch the minimally viable product this are having those one on one conversations get the feedback and then added integrate as you go and guess what they feel they're part of building this course is Cami the year creating they'll love that so Kathleen you haven't always had this much value to drop the oven always been a genius in these areas take us back to a time where you really struggled and specifically your worst off for a moment I want to take us to that moment in time and tell us that story are eight fell my biggest mistake with my business was doing everything myself and I had heard of burnout that I didn't think it happened to me I thought I was invincible and I was very very wrong the good news is that my business grew pretty quick lead but the bad news is that I didn't know how to delegate or really even who I could delegate to I was working hours each week wearing and too many half and try and juggle it all after I was about two years and I hit a wall I was exhausted stressed out completely worn out I had no energy I can focus on any new projects and I you know I hate to admit that they think a lot of people entirely I wasn't taking care of myself no way a bath i knew i shed and I know better you're finished or I shall slap on the rest so I took a couple weeks off to take a step back and chill and I just really take a look at what I was doing wrong then put the pieces into place to start delegating more things sell I'm a list of all the things I was doing the things that I coalition him again and do my own graphics Facebook ads social media <Music/Noise> writing my own email sales pages like crazy like when I think about it I broke down that list of the things they didn't enjoy doing or new okay maybe I like killing him but clearly my time could be spent better elsewhere like and can stuff I think if I was going to continue to build the business things we have to change and I was immediately start delegating and outsourcing and that's what a dead end at first it felt kind of scary that delegating led to actually making a lot more money and reducing my stress because I can focus on fewer things and you than batter and enjoy the process more without feeling like I was being pulled in a million different directions he's taken a couple sentences like it was an example of some of the delegated or to Liu's <Music/Noise> this will help you in your life if I knew she could maybe apply to their businesses pretty quickly it was more delegating to people so I found a graphic designer to do my graphics I found a great person to do my Facebook ads so for me personally it was more finding people that could do what I was doing and they could do better by the way for a nation lead EU what to do a bunch of things like okay like decently because this is going to happen where <Music/Noise> hazard you want to just invest in your business and bring on creepy five hats guy I've I've I have a graphic designer <Music/Noise> developer Ivan Amazon personally that just does my Amazon stuff you know that's why we're doing twenty thirty thousand dollars a month at Amazon I could be tinkering around <Music/Noise> swaddle I have critical time the BBB can a couple thousand dollars But no lets twenty x that's Vince you know what I'm paying a contractor to focus on this those pennies to That's return on that investment so think about your business in that manner now Kathy those Aussie an ah ha moments was delegating be people on your team or just kind of hiring out things you shouldn't be doing what's one of the other great ideas you've had tickets to that moment in time the you had this great aha moment in the walk as to how you turned it into success I know it's so funny that we don't feed all these things in one or an air brake on one am <Music/Noise> a big aha moments came as a result of what people were asking for Dad I didn't even think out of for example I offer a few different kinds of programs for my clients like a six month health coaching program at thirty jumpstart starred in some others and I was adding more programs people asked me Hey if I buy them all can I get a discount and I thought Oh my gosh that is brilliant why didn't I think about that cell based on what my audience wanted I packaged five of the programs that I had into a bundle and then when they purchased them bundled they would save one hundred and fifty dollars so it made it are real no brainer when they were at the checkout to feel happy that by these programs separately or I can buy this bundle and heck it's going to save me money so go and buy that soon and that has been a huge seller for me and I honestly don't think I would've ever thought I'd do if people massed sell big lesson number two as listen to your audience is asking for and find a way to make it happen if you can doing that one super simple Fein has had a dramatic impact on my revenue and yeah I wouldn't even talk to native people have asked me about it says Brady down now is one incentive to make sure our listeners gets from that great idea not listen to what your audience is asking Michael when they're e mailing <Music/Noise> you what are the most common question that you're getting and see if that something you can either add here per gram package it differently or offer something they'll be with the most fired up about right now like what gets you jumping out of the bed in the morning Arif this is thanks in part teal I am super excited about

you are really just felt out of wondering are they even want to have to offer and how might that the pieces and the place from attack and logistic standpoint and I really I did that one day the time and found the people that knew more than I did about the things I either need to learn or didn't want to do myself that deftly just that the element of self doubt was the best advice you have ever received it doesn't have to be perfect just do it if it's County's air quotes or if it's good enough you're ready to roll now I still have free myself of this on a regular basis but it's really help me move forward much more quickly instead of getting hung up on every single little detail and things being perfect was a personal habit that contributes to your success I have to say one of the most important habits that help me is writing down my goals and keeping a weekly To Do lists so I stay focused and I've tried out for this but I'm really a pen and paper kind of gal so that works for me I just use our weekly paper planner and check the check things off with a goal if I don't rate my things down they need you for the week I feel scattered and I don't get as much done because I lose track of what a filthy focusing on like for mapping out projects like major projects will use try lower ever known that from a daily to do's and reminders <Music/Noise> these paper your <Music/Noise> like ever notes with Fire Nation was use all the time is Graham early if the grammar and spelling checker and I use it mostly for my blog posts and emails super handy level of a few recommend just one

business model in her <Music/Noise> is helping our viewers have breakthroughs and paradigm shifts around creating more wealth and success in their business in life to take a minute fill the gaps from that in Sean give us a little glimpse of your personal life gosh really want to start with a past life that's out there that that kind of fun and so I live in Scottsdale Arizona married happily married for almost twenty two yeas three furry four legged friends to dogs and cats and two children William and Olivia who are twenty one and sixteen so they're a lot of my Y as to why I do what I do lose <Music/Noise> but what I would love to know is the What's of you do right now because that's were moving into right <Music/Noise> the personal because that kind of gives the flavor is going to get into the area of expertise he says you a name like what is that Vanessa my area fact that he's on the seas built from the inside out and very quick set of history he is that I found myself almost going bankrupt a few years into business and when I think almost bankrupt they talking about eighteen hundred dollars away from bankruptcy and that the irony though is at the time I actually had a six figure deal it was a lesson almost like a two hundred thousand dollar contract I was doing really well thus far the outside world was concerned and yet here I was to sabotaging behind the scenes and so my area of expertise has been built from gritty my <Music/Noise> around that time and learning to having to build a business from the ground up but also having to understand empower Lal what the shifts past me that need to take place what's that in a game work and particularly in a game walk around being more successful and receiving and handling more wealth in one's life so kind of empowered when I'm helping people build their business but I feel if we know having that conversation as well when missing out a massive chunk of learning good dive into the word intervene were going to get green <Music/Noise> what is something that <Music/Noise> our viewers just don't know these fine over and over again when it comes in a game like that where missing that we probably should now ask a question I mean one of the things I often feel like entrepreneurs say for example is nothing's gonna stop me I'm so gung ho I am ready to go I'm not mistaken all the rest and feel less like these names that that that the times that it does <Music/Noise> and again we see that on social media so you know you could have an awful lot of courage to actually say at Family First add anxiety coming up or matching not soul about you know really where I'm going here and so I do feel that they can be quite a lot of denial as to the set of emotional experience of you know the entrepreneurial journey and that's really what I mean by the end again it's you know how does it feel like what are some of the emotions that we go through I call it the emotional roller coaster one day that's something that's really big and exciting enough but Unit C and as a new client that we sign up and then the next day we have a climb backing out or the sudden it feels like crickets every single endeavor that we going through said can feel like emotionally well up and down the whole time to be really careful about how we how that affects all decision making process in business too if we make decisions from that sketch more anxious place they can and very different to making them from that excited place and in fact one of the things I'm still teaching my entrepreneurs is not to be made to panic or excitement but how about we go to more grounded centered place and make decisions from that and I think that that grounded and centered ness is something that's not talked about enough pasta pasta because it sounds sexy enough yet it's very powerful is super powerful if you're going for the marathon violation of UN to be around not just tomorrow not just next month next year five years from now going to be because the ground is because you <Music/Noise> putting one foot in front of the other in taking care of the balance of your life slide at the flea love that ideal in essence I mean I deftly subscribe to know you did kind of briefly mention a struggling time that you went through and I don't wanna talk about when you're struggling times actually want to dive deep into what you consider your worst arterial moments today so an asset don't plan to share a love that band aid take us to that moment that I kind of get that story of meeting bankrupt if I was preparing for this I realize that that wasn't the toughest moment and that the toughest moment she came pretty recently Flight be on the same time I thought you wanted to share that because we'll have the stories of being way in the past and a ten years on and it's all different I thought No to show one that's really authentic and that small presents so I host live events as part of our business model we host an event called the big bold event that takes place at the end of the year and last year's event which was our third year running we was six weeks prior to the event going live in six weeks if you know anything about the event model is crunch time to close contracts are in place financially I am seriously commited Idol lot of financial responsibility at that point and this is a lot of risk taking involved and sponsors on board and promises that are being made and I got a phonecall from a mate done major hotel chain that was am hosting the events to tell me they would no longer be hosting it and I can honestly tell you it really was one of those moments when I thought I was going to pass out I mean I just couldn't believe that I was hearing this I kind of reconsider his temporary shock as in everything was prepared and ready to go this was once an Aria that I had never ever advocate stopped to consider could happen and with that not only were they so this is the most of the wrong person you know what the contract what you speaking to the other people that you've double booked with and clearly they had a much better off on the table presumably by much bigger business and they decided no they were they were going to go into full breach of contract on me as a small business owner and not only that it was a holiday week at our event was taking place on the holiday weekend on a crucial school weekend and it meant that the whole city was already full so they'd already for me to say not only were they cancelling but I had already phoned around their part the hotel to see who could help me and basically the news was nobody could it really was a mess I'd love to say Tony said wow there were quite the same thing and that she does kind of the interesting part of the I mean obviously I'm in a few practical things that happened I had to process the information incredibly quickly and then immediately call Milan as well to say hey what can be done this of course call in help but what's really interesting is I think we often look at these tough times and we expect that to be this very elegant in sight and something that looks very pretty and something we can be proud to live on this if somebody being see me behind the scenes and behind the scenes then i was like a Tigris you know fighting to protect my turf and was really interesting is it just kicked in this kind of inner edge of how the day you you know I have really done everything by the had my facts out of this contract I would have been liable for tens and tens of thousands of dollars and as a small business owner yet I have to be in integrity with my commitments and I taken very seriously yet he you all missed a big hotel chain or misses big hotels on this day is in fact make that happen to be guys that are listening it just happens to him and that today but the message and then you know and hey you on this kind of thing has the potential to actually put me out of business itself and so was interesting is it sort of kicked in not in a U S The question the beginning ignite the fire that was that was lit inside of me six weeks before that event was also you you just watch you needn't think that this is going to stop me and Zan and not only that you know I'm going to take a stand teh for small businesses and role model what it looks like to have fair compensation and really you know hold you to keeping up your end of the deal here so the long and the source of it was I mean we had to rally as a very small scene with a very small amount of time and relocate to another city which actually ended up being in awe to our advantage that was like the the major gifts and winds up being a much better property and hotel that had breached the contract had to pay the difference so who is a gift and we ended up with our most successful event today so there were a lot of gifts on the other sucking up on the other side of it but it was sort of the If it for me it was more interesting to really see my own process of how I approached it cheering that sort of fights and to you know to come up against you know basically something that's threatening my business and my community see and realize that you know hey I'm really really serious and committed to what we're doing here and I'm not going to be stopped so we just have to know we will make a workaround furnishing your back is against the wall when you <Music/Noise> other choice but to survive you survive and that's why we're still around here you know sixty thousand <Music/Noise> the humans are survivors we survive you know I love saying that baby effect kicks in is one of those things where you know Yeah I get are scared to make that phone call or knock on someone's door you're scared to do what I get is nerve wracking but guess what when you have that baby of the child in all so new looking your baby's eyes you're more scared of not providing food shelter to that big when you are making that little silly outbound phone call things get put into perspective in that fire comes up and you make the most of it now that so well getting and in really any detail just real quickly what exactly did you do to get the conversation that you needed from this hotel back and was anything additionally had to do as well was it just make up that difference the ad that was a lot because at that point to say I've really taken a stand for my community and that you know we we say that we provide high end service and cultural community say he was a place I was I really had to demonstrate that so I went way above and beyond the contract to mean that was certain things contract that contract when that's the big lessons really makes a great legal advice because our contract was solid super sell it for the things that they just couldn't get out of but then it really went into the whole inconvenience the We are very very small team with limited resources and we are now stretched to mamak for the time when you know we should be marketing this event and just making sure that they had to do the right thing by our clients that were flying into another town our clients that were attending that event because it was in their local town now they had to be relocated so we were able to surprise some of those attendees with Hailey yes yes with changing the venue and it's actually been a better venue but by the way you're getting three nights you know in this gorgeous room plus we've arranged for you to have like a hundred dollars a day to take care of your additional like Simon Says and by the way if you need transportation which is a two hour journey that can be thrown in as well so we sort of we know we were able to go you know really go above and beyond for them for those clients that wing convenience to find his nicest in the uni to me you know the you doing right by York lies The you've been wrong step up take a stand and do what's right now Vanessa have to be much more concise with this story but I still want you to tell it just in a much smaller shorter man or one of your greatest ideas give us one of your aha moment you've had in your <Music/Noise> an entrepreneur ok and this sounds really trite it came it became quite a few years ago but it was the whole idea of building a business around ideal clients and now it sounds very simplistic when I say something that we teach but at the time and it had never dawned on me that we could really craft a profile of ideal clients and look at who we can do our best best work with and who would really pay off handsomely and market to them and fill our business with ideal clients which she called him champagne clients not in mine as the sole key lesson that we talk about here for podcasting where Cushing people with podcasts

"8","Smart Passive Income Podcast","268_How_to_Up_Your_Online_and_Offline_Game_with_Jordan_Harbinger.mp3","this is a smart having a podcast with Pat Flynn such a Number two hundred and sixty anyway the Welcome <Music/Noise> passive Income podcast where it's all about working hours no so you can sit back and reap the benefits later the Note <Music/Noise> he's the founder and president of the four AM globe pad place by everybody thank you so much for joining me today in this session of the Smart has become podcast really excited because we're bringing back guess who's been on the show before and he's one of my favorite people as of late because he's the host of one of the only podcasts I listen to actually only subscribed in religiously listen to two different shows at this point I'm first one is the model Health Show with Jon Stephenson who's also been a guest on the show before but that's not who were who were interviewing today we are interviewing Jordan harbinger the host of the art of charm podcast and the reason why I only listen to two shows I mean to go back in time I remember subscribing to over thirty different podcast episodes which was awesome because I could get and consume all that content in a very short time period however I realized that the more I listened to podcast episodes the last I was actually doing to implement those things so I didn't and one I've implemented what I learned from jammy France and from Internet Business mastery it's a concept called just in time learning and that is I only allow myself to consume information and learn about things related to the next task that I'm doing this really helped with cutting out all the things that aren't necessary right now now that doesn't mean I just ignore everything else except for what's next on my list but I put those things aside I put them into an ever Note folder so I have all these different folders with topics ranging from pay interest to Facebook advertising to technology things that I find that are interesting that I just don't need right now but when it's time when it's time for me to start learning about pay interest I have all that information readily available for me is just now's not the right time now the model shows a show I listen to consistently because I'm always focused on my health and then the art of charm is one a listen to because it's focused on personal development in a number of different ways from business to <Music/Noise> at home to just having energy in your life and and having great interactions with people which obviously affects your entire life and so that's those are two shows that I listen to even know they're not necessarily exactly related to the next thing that I'm working on they are related to just everything that I'm doing all the time so health of course important effects all my business and then of course learning to communicate and interacting with people that's what the art of charm helps and serves me for and I can say listen to and so very happy to welcome back Jordan harbinger from the art of Turnpike as you can find him look up the art of time on I tunes or look up or go to the art of charm dot com Well about Jordan he's first of all great storytelling teller you'll hear that he's also a great communicator he feel like I feel like it is exactly what to say in this is obviously something he's great at so great that he teaches and he does workshops in those kinds of things to help people become better versions of themselves and who they are who they represent and that's why I wanted to bring him on to talk more about essentially upping our game for business for life or communication with relationships and so all the things we're going to talk about related to how to be a better host on your show if you have a podcast or video channel had to be a better speaker and things like along with that to you how to walk into a room and have people just immediately have a good vibe with the like all these kinds of things <Music/Noise> useful especially if you start going to conferences and things like that start interacting with people in person but even if it's done online stuffs can be really helpful so let's just dive right in this is Jordan harbinger from the art of charm podcast to go with the chasm so happy to welcome back Jordan harbinger from the art of charm podcast website and program in all things amazing related to Jordan thanks again for coming back on the show today this is always fun and I have great history no we've not only have interviewed you've interviewed me but no I feel like we have a good vibe we can relate to each other were a lot were very similar with where we're in business in separate trading spots nine teens and staff what's what's been happening in your life recently like what what what's got you excited before we get some of the meaty content of the show sure so we hit three million downloads for the month of February which was super exciting that's more to me and that you never know man you our trading we were literally like a ninety eight ninety nine in iTunes for months and months and months and months I just got sick of looking at us like neck and neck the whole time will tell me what you did like how can I come back to your level Malik what did you do what did you do anything that actually really enhanced where your podcast was at yeah you know there are there are few things I did that I thought were for sure going to work and didn't do squat or maybe did a little and there are other things that I did kind of for the love of the game turned out to be some of the best things I could've done so for example all these little tricky things I used to ask every person who email Dan and we're talking hundreds of people per day his desk all of them to review the shell ice as all who share the show I posted every episode on social media I engaged with everybody on those and I engaged in discussions on those and I put them on Reddit and into all of that contributed to very little I mean got a ton of iTunes reviews don't get me wrong but it didn't really get us into more people's brains in more people's ears the things that actually made the difference for me was after a while I was on NPR and there was a journalist was interviewing me and she had seen me speak and vent about hacking thing that I had done a talk given about this social engineering thing that I had done and I soccer note that in her journal Island hey do you mind walking me through your notes and she had these great notes on my talk and she had notes on the talk that she and I had very briefly after my talk which is like ten maybe ten or so seconds long longer than we talked just based on a few things I'd said to her and other reporters at this event and then we had a phone call she a great notes on that and then she had googled me and found all these different sources and get great notes on that and I went only us this is how professionals prepare for show and this is a few years ago and I started to go hi I'm clearly lacks because she did a great job intervene and I was like out now I know you work for NPR you really get this Zune marketplace that show on American Public Media and so then I started instead of just having people on my show which I used to just do the essays to have someone on the show I would have read their website maybe this new couple episodes of their stuff they had one or looked at some of their tweets and social media and I would interview them and have a conversation that's how I did the Art of Chun podcast for six plus years and after that point we just passed our tenth birthday after that point after the six birthday or sell give or take I started to really kick things into high gear because the TPM marketplace interview and I started to read the book that the person had written in its entirety I would read the thank you Paige and I reach out to some of the acknowledgment people try to get anecdotes I would look at the Amazon reviews I would read the different sources online from this person I would listen to interviews of them done by other people which is great no Israelis decent enough snow to my little mind not agree to use at some level but those he is now create those notes and then I would go over those notes the day before the shell in right questions about my own notes in my notes and so that became the structure of the interview and so I went from mildly entertaining conversationalist to possibly the most comprehensive interviewer that most of the guests on the show have ever actually spoken with outside of their particular nice so if I'm interviewing say Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs who is just on the show recently I will watch dozens of episodes of that I will read everything the guys written on social media and online journal read dozens of entries about him online and that that level of preparation even though a lot of it is redundant really resulted in me knowing this person's content almost as well as they did and so I started to kind of go for it with some of these guests and scientists and I know I've done a decent job within any given interview if a neuroscientist or behavioral economist or something like that if I ask the question they go ah good question nobody's ever asked me that if I know the answer but I think it would probably be THIS THIS THIS and THIS or great question I don't think anybody's ever caught that you clearly read the book those are the kind of things that you want going for you because what it means is you're dragging them out of their auto pilot mode in terms of giving their sound bites during an interview and you're making them think and very very very few show hosts do that if for making the guests think you're making the audience think and for people to listen to the art charm they're not just listening because of corny jokes or something like that they actually want to think they want to learn same with your audience making them think they they go Ah this is a good use of my time not yet another show with a bunch of crap o la not that I don't care about you really want to challenge them to guests and the audience and that resulted in a lot of people sharing because when people learn a lot when they're challenged they can confidently say you need to listen to the show you need to listen to the show not just Hank I have this one on my podcast and subtle and kind of funny they know that they can confidently share it because you're not going to disappoint the person they're sharing it with so it doesn't cost them any social capital to recommend you write they're not going to it's not like we recommend a restaurant a person goes and goes Yeah I got sick from that place you go oh and then you may think I can never listen to Pat again he's got terrible restaurant recommendations right they actually gain favor they gain social capital by recommending art of charm because the person does wow that was definitely worth it what else what else we have in mind or they want to talk about the content with their friend so stepping up the craft of interviewing the preparation made a huge difference in the quality of the show which actually resulted in a lot more sharing which actually surprised me yeah that's really interesting so you're almost creating the show's cool for people to gain social capital and when you take that approach you have to make it great or else people are going to share it all and end my question to you relate to that and I told you earlier when knows where this interview is going to go last and we had Jordan on the show we're going to talk about the whole business plan of our charm and we even discuss the AL and lean over to get into that day but I like with this going right now which a would be worse whatever letter we're at right now is also another sign of a good interviewer a kind just take things where you want them to go based on what you guys have at that time and we're wondering now is ask you if you take that level of preparation how do you make sure you still connect with your audience because I've listened to podcast before where it's obvious that the person did their research but when they are asking questions when they're having a conversation I'm like I feel left out as a listener like ie skipped over but stuff like how it like how you make sure you bring your audience with you to leave them behind yeah this is really an important question because I think for us a lot of times it's a really easy for us as hosts to be so into let's say Smart passive Income strategies are on line business it's really easy for us to lose the audience any kind of have to remember that every single episode you create it someone's first time hearing you so you gotta make sure that what you're talking about is applicable to everyone regardless of whether or not they've heard your show before and you've also got to make damn sure that your knots what does that sort of term for when you're talking in a jargon the bottle and nobody understands it group rights not group think but it's basically when you and I are talking in such jargon decoded esoteric language that people who are at our level will understand that's a great way to alienate your audience and I've switched off many a podcast about business when they start talking and that way I've switched off many shows for every reason when they start really getting into details that are would take me too much time to go back and think about so you have to not only think like a beginner when your host but you also have to keep the advanced folks entertained and that's a very tough balance is a hosted to do in real time and I think it's very crucial to make sure that you can do that so the best hosts around they're able to take complicated topics like what you take in make it really relate able instead of highly technical and intimidating and that takes in my opinion takes years of practice it does him absolutely does and I'm still improving myself and I'm sure you know that there are ways that you can improve as well if you were the comments on your own podcast what would be one area that you wish you could improve upon well it's funny should mention that because I'm always working on some specific area of my presenting skills on the art of charm and you'd mentioned yeah when you're good host you just take things where you want to go based on the vibe you're getting and I went through going through different levels of competence when it comes to hosting for example so when I first started it was like ok prepare everything and write an outline of the show and present it and then after that was NO don't write an outline is too mechanical just have a conversation and then I kind of went back to actually you need to have a really good outline with a lot of details and you need to know that outline so well that you can have a conversation about it that sounds really laid back and it sounds like you're really well and form naturally but you've really put in a ton of work to it and sort of the next step for me is rounding out that vibe a little bit more so making it sound even more conversational even more laid back even our sort of just two guys hanging out or to a guy a girl hanging out talking about this is talking about that I mean we've had to head to CA on recently and we had General McChrystal on recently amid these are guys that live in a different world than me making that sound like I just sort of met them at a restaurant having a conversation that's the vibe I really want but I also want all of the background information and learning to be present there and to be able to deliver that vibe but also had that amount of background study and any given topic that's been very challenging and that's what I'm working on right now does it make sense yet as thank you for sharing that do you feel like everytime you go into an interview now you're confident it's going to agree or are their interviews that you go into where it says you're not getting that response that you want and if that's the case would you do at that point I actually have a lot of Yeah I go into every interview pretty much expecting it to be great and that's not just like what you visualize becomes reality I mean I expected to be great because the level of Pratt that's gone into it and the I'm not afraid to kill my darlings is our friend Michael Port likes to say what I mean it's his wife and most he says in a report the real what that means the show biz term and what that means is you might create something and it's amazing <Music/Noise> and you think it's awesome and it just doesn't fit in it doesn't make it in the final product and you can't really lean on your sunk cost and this works in business and works in writing it works and podcasting it works and everything and what I mean by that is I might read an entire book and go that was just fascinating I can't wait to talk to this guy and then I'll record the interview and then at the end my producer or me just goes yeah that was only okay and it's very tempting to go book but I read the whole book and we recorded the whole thing we have a picture and I flew to L A to record it and it's just like Do you want to put out something that didn't end up how it was supposed to or do you want to kill your darlings and basically respect the audience's time knowing that what you've created is not worth putting them through and that's been very tough and that's something that I had to learn the hard way a lot but now to answer your question there's so many things that going to show preparation and screening in gas did this and that me and meeting with my producer and all that stuff that by the time it gets to be the point where I'm jumping on Skype or meeting them in person that interview there's almost no chance can go wrong unless the person and that the cases when it does go wrong is when usually the person is like I'm sick today but I'm able to do it you're thinking on now or they'll pay the studio thing broke Simon a conference room in your dislike <Music/Noise> not going to go as well as his plan and and so there's always those sort of little x factors which is why real big time radio and TV studios those people control everything I ever been on a daytime TV show for example but if you have for those of people who have their hse there so weirdly at first I thought it was weird now it makes sense they're very good about control they're good about controlling the environment and I mean on the Today show and they're like Oh OK you're going to stay at this hotel and I thought I live in New York I don't really want to stay at hotel it doesn't make any sense and they go PM Please say the hotel and the carrots I gotta say though town like we're going to pick you up in the morning and I thought I can take the subway I have a metro card and five blocks away no we're going to pick you up in the morning and I thought alright fine so I got into town I get some sleep and I go up in the morning in his car there and a driver there any drives into the underground garage at the Today show <Music/Noise> we get out and there's a makeup person and hair person the clothing person and then after I did that I remember talking to our PR person this is when I was on Sirius XM satellite Radio talking with our PR person saying why did he do that it's just a waste of money and she goes No they want to know that you're not out drinking the night before because I realize we did meet with the producer at nine pm that was weird yeah this weird late meeting him in to talk about seemingly nothing and then when I got up there the driver was there and we got in the car so they knew it says that driver saw me he could call the executive producer of the associate producer and go gotta write they have in our flat they're not default drunk or hung over or inaction they're not freaking out there's nothing weird <Music/Noise> have a black guy there's nothing happening here that's going to be strange we going for hair and makeup were there so early I remember thinking we're just killing time here and the reason is because they want to make darn sure for a live show that there be no <Music/Noise> there controlling what you're doing get time to feed you and give you coffee and get to dress to be cufflinks and do your hair and make you shave again whatever it needs they require that level of control now we can't do that as podcast or is just yet however it really showed me the amount of thought and control that goes into creating a really good show whatever you think it's that time TV show does something similar and I get to me that was fascinating and it made me sort of my own game when it came to doing this show because people might think Oh yeah you know radio shows and podcasts he does have a conversation and great conversation no good hosts they make it work so easy because they're still practiced in there so versed in the content but truthfully they have worked ridiculously hard to make it look as easy as it is it's just like an athlete playing basketball or Tony Hawk who we had on the show skateboarding reason he looks like he can just sort of put one foot on that thing in cruisin do some nine twenties or whatever is because he's been doing it for decades but if you get on that skateboarding you try to do a flip our halfpipe you're going to the hospital face yeah yeah so the bed that is really fascinating actually a less excuse than a person I've never done that but I think I'd be very inspired by the production and how things are put together it almost makes me remember the recent viral video that is not enough you seen the start of a link to it in the show notes if in case people haven't seen it but I'm sure he probably had it was on the BBC some guy was doing an interview this guy was in his home is very professional interviews in his suit at his desk and then the door open behind them it's like his little toddler toddling in and the and in the one in the roller comes in <Music/Noise> comes or or somebody comes in is like riffs about other <Music/Noise> like is this hilarious and just makes me wonder if you've experienced anything like that in terms of OK unexpected things that happened during interviews or during recordings or something and kind of if you could if you have in mind like the walk is the in kind what happened from there oh yeah cash there's so many little things that go around it once I had a different audio desk right now got this nice wooden custom desk that I really love God all my interfaces in it but before had this big plastic roti case like a lot of people carry for audio gear once my cat got stuck in there in the middle of the shell and it's kind of a problem because there's wires in there and not only to the cat and plan something organic something but I don't know I mean they could get shocked I really don't know how all that gear is built and it's really hot in there so she got in there thinking oh it's nice and warm here and then only ask if he can get out and and so I had cat issues right had to stop and like surgically remove the cat from a woman of cables plug it back in and get back to it but there was another time where I was on the Jeff probe show is a host of Survivor and this is a daytime TV shows like being filmed as we did it and I sat on this couch and as I sat on the couch there are but there was however was the guest before me to sound awful but whoever was the guest before me was significantly overweight and I took their seat and at first I thought Wow this person really squished the cushion down it should recover soon maybe I'll slide over I didn't realize was there was clearly a board underneath this cheap studio couch there was a board that had come dislodged or metal pole or something that had gotten dislodged and bent so midway through one of my sentences you hear thump in my legs go up in the air and my butt sinks down like half a foot of ash are born with like sitting way back like a dentist's recliner chair and the middle of his daytime TV show and at the end of the day when they aired it Finally I mean when it was broadcasting it was going it was out there but I think in all subsequent re runs because when I look for the clip online it was kind of this abrupt cut where the beginning of my sentence sounds like a sentence fragment and immediately shift to the host saying something like Well that's certainly interesting in it's like what did that happen weapon there oh yeah that's when my feet went up three feet the air and I ended up having to put a pillow under me so that I could sit upright it was the most awkward thing ever because of course as soon as that happens you're under studio lights you turn red your makeup you feel like is running you don't want to keep touching your face because you're on camera and you're sweating you're sweating you're sweating a sliding and just trying to ignore this whole thing and realizing that I'm doing a terrible job of looking calm and collected trade all on national TV that was kind of fun and I realized at that point that no matter how much effort you put into something no matter how much kind of control you've got over the situation there's always going to be these wild card things that happen that you just can't do anything about like a guest sitting in your spot before you get there yeah so funny love it now you mentioned and our good friends Michael Niemi port to help a lot of people with public speaking in getting on stage and we sort of talked a little bit about the pie testing stage already or studio stage but what about the real life stage in terms of public speaking I know that the last time we spoke together that was something you were hoping to get more into it obviously sounds like that's going very well for you tell us about that journey was like to third shift from podcast stage to real life stage sure it's old switching from the podcast called a quote stage aka really hot room in my house that's probably going to be a kid's bedroom one day come that sound proofed which will also help when it gets really hot this weekend the stage thing was interesting the reason I picked it up was originally i thought oh you know this is great I mean to be in for more people it's not really the case your podcast is almost certainly going to be in front of more people than the few that fit into any given room however for me it was kind of like and I really that good and seeing in hosting a show I mean if I can't do on stage and I really that good at it and so I thought why not just get really good at speaking because we see people who are really good at speaking it somehow adds credibility to just every other area of their life and there was also something that just didn't make sense here I am hosting the art of charm about charisma personal magnetism networking relationship development it would look pretty weird if I got up on stage was like hello everybody and shaking and dripping sweat that wouldn't look too good it would look like I didn't walk the walk so I did hire Michael any port to whip me into major speaking shape created a keynote which I've given a lot of times and really big stages and I like you I felt like I just kind of was decent at it and it became really funny you give huge key notes you give really good ones it seems like you're also into speaking right I mean you can't not be in for hiring for gg and DeLorean has such a blast doing it something that reminds me of when I use to perform with the band them literally marching band not the rock band that was probably my dream back the day but even before you practice something you rehearsing it over and over and over again and then all this and it's time to go out and perform that's what I feel like when I'm onstage I get that rust I got back in the day and I sort of zone out when I'm onstage and just on autopilot because I've been practicing so much and then afterwards I'm just like back into reality and what has happened in ads I have this amazing high coming off a stage and plus the interactions that you have with people afterwards him to receive experiences while people come to peace in whatever job he did but not only that just how much they've learned from you and how much you've been able to affect their lives or what their decisions are going to be from that point forward it really is an amazing experience have I mean what do you feel being on stage and after it's all done I always am secretly relieved that its overall say that but I love the fact that I'm able speaking was also great for these reasons Al Ameen that's a great question I love the feeling I get when it's done I love the feeling of the visibility and the people coming up to talk to you and saying I really like it but you're you're right there's one thing that I missed that was one of the main reasons why learn how to speak which was when you go to an event and or a speaker not only do you get promo for the event from the marketing from everybody knowing who you are but when you go to an event and you want to talk to one of the speakers they're often really busy in other people's land and etc et-cetera But if you want to go to an event and talk to one of the speakers and you're another speaker they're often like Yeah let's go to dinner or speaker there at the VIP thing we say Hey mean some of the other speakers are going to go grab a beard you want to come with us and you're kind of in this other pool of people that are sort of pre screened and vetted and so he's really really busy speakers will often say Yes I want to go and hang out with the other speakers and so it's kind of it's kind of like an automatic ultra VIP ticket to every event you go to that is also free or even our ally positive in that some events will pay you to come and speak and take you to a speaker there and put you up every treat after the event with all of the other speakers in fact I'm going to an event in Australia called we are podcasting podcasting events and the event itself was really fun people are really cool who are in it but after that event there's a speaker retreats for days on the beach at a beach house and it's awesome and I went last year and am becoming really good friends with all these people staying in this house and you know grilling up veggies veggies and eating and going surfing and swimming and that's the kind of thing that you actually couldn't buy a ticket to that right Yeah it was an experience only available to the event organizers and some of the speakers at the event and that kind of access creates relationships which as you know from the entire point of the art charms that relationships are your strongest lever so being able to put myself in a position that created the super strong relationships and those levers was a no brainer even though it required learning how to speak facing my fears paying blood money to have Michael Port won the best guys in the world in a report train me how to do this and flying out to them to do it for it was a twenty day class I took with them spread out over four weeks in frickin Philadelphia I live in San Jose so it wasn't cheap in terms of time or money but it was but so worth it to to learn that skill set yeah me was that something you are planning for in terms of connecting to the speakers as you are starting to become a speaker is that a by product of it's actually something I was planning for which is why was the president mentioned earlier I was actually planning that because I thought Oh I'm going to speak at some events in a meet the other speakers I didn't think that some of the speakers would become so my closes friends I met Hughes began a van I think we may have known each other before but we definitely hung out at different events as speaker is I know was it an ex or something yet laid back day but that's when we met each other we got close and we've since stay connected with each other yeah yeah exactly"

number two hundred and sixty nine ext welcome to the Smart passive Income podcast where it's all about working hard now so you can sit back and reap the benefits later and now you're toast most of his closet consists of t shirts from startup companies had played by he would every happen here and thank you so much for joining me in a session of the semi passive income podcast super stoked to hear am really excited for this interview because it's a very unique one we are interviewing one of the four co founders of a company called charities and what is Chevy they sell <Music/Noise> shorts name might be thinking to yourself well how interesting can an interview from company but shorts can be well this has been one of the most inspiring and interesting and educational interviews I've done in a while because Tom over at Chez he's going to reveal exactly how they've been able to build this massive massive brand and most cult like following for their product and how they been able to use content to do that and how they empower their community and how is it now this company spreads like wildfire because of word of mouth and it's just really inspiring especially for me now that I'm creating a physical product very soon I think for anybody you want to create a sense of culture you want to create that kind of word of mouth recognition and and know that this is this is exactly what you need to listen to what's really cool also about this is is the meaning behind what they do and how they portray that and how they are like I said bringing this community to gather in a way that grows the brand which is again empowers the people who are actually the customer so we're going talk alot about that so let's not wait any further this is Tom from Shelby's comments to this guys had here with Tom from Shelby's chubby short stack on time thank you and welcome to the SBA I guess thanks for being here absolutely thank them so you and I actually is for semi spoken but I've heard about Chevy so many times from my good friend Matt who many of the listeners know who is my partner in a number of business is and who also his company's help you with your website design first of all when Matt first introduced chubby short stock Omni I was like ok retail store clothes okay whatever and I went to the site and I was immediately blown away from immediately answered To understand like the personality of Chevy is in the culture and then I went over to rinse around like holy crap three hundred thousand followers and you sell shorts like oh what's that like you found this amazing company with so much like such a great following a huge culture behind it like what what's what's it been like for you I mean it's amazing you know for us it's all about the community and thought about giving people a good time so that's the idea when it is that it is entirely about having pie and making jokes and that the building in short shorts company is so awesome that we have this community grow to love our product that we put out yeah it's very very very awesome work expresses how did you get started with his yeah so so <Music/Noise> there's there's four total co founders business I'm one of them and get started because we're all just good buddies and honestly we all wore short shorts and that and we'll have like different like legendary pairs of short shorts and that they were like that down combat uncle's house thousands in the store and everyone had a white marquee pair would wear again or whatever and just the walls to Abram and the other side of the sass in her study was just really label it with washboard abs alone covered shirtless guys are going to church in cargo shorts and that we relate with that kind of the products was was so obvious to us because we couldn't find anywhere we were just so passionate about it and down and the brands are that of all of that kind of that feeling of everything just a little too serious in the fashion and so does other work on what sort of content to be put out what sort of messaging and that and done and we made fifty pairs that the group decide on a whim that I sell and we went to the shores of Lake in California and and we had a plan to set up booths and we go from from groups on the beach like marketing people about the product and write about sports or bored I am asking to buy them having their rest in the same sorts with the smallest in class and the Erie held upright he launched the website and thirty thousand eleven and that's really when the marketing of the concert began and was immediately something where people where we are models that we that we were hired with Justice else reading or science like this pristine kind of dark that was really fun and we wrote our emails you are likely ready for that was really tan and that the Colonel was my day is like one of my friends and we want to expand their spending as much as we can't do that is what all of our finances are really the personality of the Grahams and and and that's with a rich man like me that's the way are adding more and more expensive this group of wealthy like the world and we meet somebody on the street of restaurants and lastly they are personality humor I could staff the one thing about Martin was involved in that building that community group that focuses on what we care about what we think that I can hear on your website and I scroll down and then I see what's on his mission statement or like hey this is this is who we are in big bold blue section where you can read and Skye has different divisions in the first thing I see here is what the Saudis here's what we what we believe we believe in the weekend and then a bunch of other ones and <Music/Noise> her Instagram as well it says hey the weekend has arrived so it was lots this weekend deal and why's that important yeah I'm impressed with the work week is encroaching more and more and more on the weekend and we can do something we need to protect and save or so we really do think about the slight battle that's being seen and the workweek and cell phone starting to creep up on more and more of our lives and connect whatever you do and we're fighting the fight of let's expand the times were having fun times are at with friends and family that's so important to us and guiding light behind everything that we do and that's that's that's when you're not stressed about your career or what you're doing next or how you can make the next you're taking time to enjoy life that's really what we do provide a service anyway that's what you are close to the content we wanted to be that kind of incidents of levity and weekend is that to us that really separates five feeling you know you you are free and that's that's exactly that's why we are on the weekend so much is it that the most important thing will just mail it sums it up perfectly I think whoever came up with that I or perhaps it's just sort of organically have popped out it's just it with sums up perfectly and I'm curious in terms of the marketing strategy in trying to figure out what has been working marking wise to expand your brand like I'm sure it's changed over time what were some of the key moments in the life of Teddy so far they've really to hockey stick serve grew the business in exposure what were some of those things that are really starting to work really well for you yes I say here out where we're one part lucky and won Park Guide to the lucky part is that we're able to put out content that people like and I have never marketed before my life written a ton of emails to my buddies but I have now written email than any corporate sense nor Rene advertising so being able to re connect with an audience in an insert to realize that people out there think alike I doing all the stuff was was was like for us and then today I was going to the pieces of the website and launch into ten relaunch the fall and right into winter so that's not short season we weren't seeing you know the key to growth there but we did is right and kind and generous every time friend or reading emails and social groups on college campuses or charities any sort of is this true to a source you can find contact info just email and said Hey this is overdoing it anybody's interested in working with us are becoming an ambassador for us let us know and and you know ninety percent of the time we got a reply that person was like yes I know somebody and it's me I like to see it here as your account forever and these are the reason was they just read the website email said that sounds ridiculous and it's and so that group was about thirty people but the ear immediately a source of kind of more driving more directive and also meanwhile we've been acquiring customers just organically which is still always our biggest customer acquisition channels just organic word of mouse and so those two things happen kind of coincidentally got to critical mass we also got the guys involved and we had was our first spring and that's when we bought the immigrated to get get us through the following summer and fall out of it within two months so her two weeks away so his interest was last six months last is too big and that's really kind of the first moment as we go along with a lot of other have huge win for us last year was another big win for us kind of been the more and more than senses last year we did three hundred and fifty million video views on this book and across kind of our channels in that with the huge winter from the content perspective and that was something where we've been working on content for a long time for all five and half years we've been running the business last year is that you're really unlocked it and once again it's it's this one part like you are good is we were lucky because we are able to bring in some extremely talented people and our content is found around and put up against any creative there and really started going we brought in to new hires like almost a year and a half ago and really started upping kind of both the output rate and also just like the creativity and that's kind of the more qualitative part but then we also institutionalized really concrete strategy and how we understand content the metrics were interested in and really apply to data driven approach to how we conduct that works like gangbusters for us that was that was another huge moment we have the growth of the business that we know that that hockey stick once again it's obvious that content has become the major things free as any <Music/Noise> his way has helped the guys get on the map and one I didn't mention earlier that liking created content that people liked and how can a person listening to this who has a physical product especially if they have a physical product how can they create this kind of awareness of their brand from the content like it's A OK years yet you have shorts like what you even start writing about and I'm curious how you address somebody who's asking themselves out like I have this product I don't even know what to write about I all I know is this product yet they thought about quite a bit I feel like the best analogy is think about the brand like about it like a person with personality and most more often than not the personalities going to be yours Trey as the designer as the person who's going to be writing or creating content so you know about the things that you care about right about the things that you have an emotional connection to you and that's really hard to find kernels and we're not knocking at the park every time I wrote but because we were pumped about it because you are passionate about it it enabled us to keep testing it right is a great book on copywriting called Hey Whipple squeeze This is more like advertising copywriting and one of the key tenets of tree to tree riding right just like a job right you have to crank through all sorts of bad ideas all sorts of bad content actually find that resonates with you what you find things that resonate with you that's when you need to see if what resonates with you resonate audience and an adoration and it's being willing to put content out and then having a healthy understanding of how to track metrics and understand magic so your body comes out an email tracking open rates click rates how people are bitten on the site from that traffic is if it's on Facebook there's all sorts of metrics have a point that rigor that you can search to develop your sense of pace make sure that your cases wind up with your audience is to say yes just started reading about things you care about and don't necessarily think about it from a business perspective of business has to be saying these things only after endorsing these products and doing that sort of thing when you don't necessarily care about that find the intersection of relates to the brand are trying to build a product you're trying to sell but also you really fundamentally care about it and it needs to be said for most and started reading through those concepts and see us start to resonate can show it to your friends show it to a group of people in your customer base if you have customers in the back and that will inform your case going forward that will get you better and better and better chance like this is our last years or if you're really really eclipsed a significant matter in the world of video prior to that I think three years ago we are on an annual basis regarding the thousand or five hundred thousand years and this year we did plant the last tree to tree and fifteen this is a process to take them time to get to that the real numbers but you're putting in the working you have the passion you already are light years above your competition what was the big difference if you don't mind sharing between a hundred to five hundred thousand years versus the three and fifty million year you had last year the Common is a content design is is really what we've been working on is this kind of miss the call a theory about the creatives of like you go to the creative about with the content that is get this work of art question for us to design the design process we apply startup methodology to content is really what we're doing is designing content as opposed to creating individual pieces and so it's this constant interplay with our community of what they like so I say first is we're putting out things that people weren't liking him as much second is warm so this book as a platform is just better for distribution for us at least so those early days were working a little more and YouTube as it was kind of more than you laugh your butt but Facebook Share to Facebook owns a share we're trying to create viral video content you really need to go directly to the source of the share because they're building up their own video class are now doing massive amounts of use so it's making sure you understand where your customer is and what the action is you want from your contacts in designing kind of bonus content and the distribution around that those two pieces where the two pieces hard work for us that there are quite a bit last year giving example of one of your more popular video is from last year in kind of what was in that video and also had that play a role in selling your choice yeah so so I'd be all answer the second part first so that the most significant way to require customers and the way the book by Alice is people talking this time and content yeah exact contents and the wee brain can sprout with the number one thing that you can talk about it was a product so product is controlled by the encounter group of people each of these that is not me and so I'm going to create a conversation will take on that mark most or less often than not people are going to be saying Hey I saw great you know the are at these guys wouldn't talk about it and a piece of cotton that connected with them in so so that that is like a huge huge huge and the Facebook shares a proxy the proxy for just a real life person conversation and this is so vital that's why we invest so much and the first parting the sea as well so we made inadvertently made one of the best performing ads of the Olympics and the kind of big international sporting event a measure of its legally allowed to say no we're fine here I think that but it's oh so we we were trying to think of what it was a kind of clearance around that event around the pitch and we have to wonder does want something I'd catch it so we thought hey what about men think that that's not a sport that and we don't quite know why not and that so we wanted for fully choreographed fully executed guys wearing nose plugs that the Bearcats and say they're sorry and we did we choreographed a cool video and then we got like the I can remember the ranking but we are in the top and the most watch ads of the Olympics beating out the very people who put millions millions of dollars by zooming in to their budgets for distribution and their production and down we spent maybe twenty five hundred dollars on shoes and a backyard or front cool and fro and that I was going to come to mind is like really really low budget where we're competing with monsters that really would depend on this same idea and once again features Yemeni I see the ad here now it's I think it's titled How do we add men's synchronized swimming to the Summer Games because it's the exact and I see that it's it's amazing how can you not talk about this day and when you see anything for the brand in the culture that you create in the personalities fits perfectly so lol Well done to you the content team I think it's fantastic I think also people listening to this it's going help them think out of the box tune it doesn't mean you have to create something ridiculous right it just means you have to create something on brand that we talked about essentially is what works what I'm trying to get out here and then I also talk about what you've done with your communities mentioned to me a few times the end it sees things that we normally hear about not related to an article of clothing but you've somehow been able to amass this amazing community and I'm sure this stems from the con to the craters well that how are you even more than the content in search of fostering this community it you've built an obviously when you have a comedian when you have fans I mean they're going to be there for you there to buy stuff but I'm curious what are the strategies involved with Australian and New York nurturing this community yet so so is not like we reuse community for content and social second meeting I try not to use it so much for advertising and direct response so they were putting out are posting organically is is not going to be sell we really don't like so I figured another Greatest salesman for what we are we're better at content and showing personality and interacting and that's really where we find and were racing their communities or form is when they're not cause that's that's one of the most important things don't don't try to sell so much more kind of create a relationship that creates demand yeah that's a thing of note is that I'm here new Instagram page have been looking for anything it says like go here by this or this is on sale I have been like going for days here I don't see any of that hopefully you don't mean that they won and even our mailing list which is very typically like a very very strong direct response from day one we've always said Friday that is just entirely caught and that was news and after that and we don't sell the Mary Don't You got that chance and give you fun things that were trying to create that future and authenticity that relationship is really important there than in the world of Instagram one of the things we saw from day one is that when people doubt the products and it was amazing and there are some of the most diverse people that one you know that's the fuel for its aggressive and so they were in serious need for ninety five percent of all the posts in there those customers we want to show you want to we want to get them on are just as much data and so we do we get probably thousands down kind of just photos that people are tagging isn't an every down to a goal we read this know if it's it's like ridiculous are a lot of personality or rethink it and you are good and that's the concern for us and that kind of reciprocity is really going with our community and that that Instagram that wouldn't exist without all of the people of the community that's a huge huge kind of exchange value there where where were their allies us to be the curators give them the content they were lying on them to descend this is ridiculous stuff and share and share with us kind of the weekend that they're adding that they had these experiences adding as much as we'd like to go do all this amazing stuff that our community oh yeah that's that's one thing it's really awesome and we did from once again we did from day one and whether it was you know our Instagram we always wanted to show is kind of the community that kind of to its farthest extent where I was fifteen we hired the male models out of our community of customers and people are fans of the brand and those are those of the models that we use so if you like that synchronized swimming video a couple of guys are just just means that we are the models and that and once again just how awesome you guys so much personality so much diversity which which is really cool as I think also like that's not super awesome cool is that and get involved in helping us kind of build this this ridiculous this ridiculous thing there were a lot of men from the outside here it's completely inspiring to see a company selling shorts have this kind of community <Music/Noise> I'm here I am right now I opened up the picture it's this guy I can relate because it's a guy wearing tan shorts the USA shorts with his son at on a doorstep and it's obviously a customer and even human at tag the customer here and it's just there raise their hands <Music/Noise> kind of thing up above that says father some level expert and the like that can exit the cell Well have you come up with those sort of mean related things I think that's something that obviously is working nowadays in terms of getting shares I mean most of the responses here in the comments are people at sharing with their friends this is us this is me in again there's no mention of the shorts there but they are obviously there are and because this is the brand I mean you're getting all this free exposure it's amazing who by Lee who comes up with those for you guys whoever is doing these means for you guys I don't know if it's a team or what but they're the really clever and they're very short but they're just perfect yeah that's that's that's our ritual and that's it Mason still Grant Garrett Wilhelm met him there and gaze so the theory is once again it's about value in making sure that you even if you don't feel inspired don't you like you that read this this whopper of a caption or of a cap that that kind of be content and Ukraine to keep reading keep trying to create that content and you know you combine that with extremely creative and talented people that is all of those guys and engines and about with my stuff and that's that's that's what we've been trying to build on the cross everything across a video that we produce the caption The roughly that we have this this rigorous edge too we wanted the best funniest out there I create content that makes people smile and laugh and even a destination that source of that will require hard work that requires us"
"10","Smart Passive Income Podcast","270_SPI_270__What_You_Need_to_Know_Before_You__Get_Physical__with_Richie_Norton.mp3","this is a smart has become podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred

<Music/Noise> during college is <Music/Noise> was <Music/Noise> see the morning m The supper ready thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> of the smart passing podcast really thankful you're here today and can be really interesting episode because we're going to dive into into the world of manufacturing in getting things sourced in getting prototypes and working with people in other countries to get those things done in shipping across the ocean in all these kinds of things related to getting a physical products dance if you're doing any sort of e commerce or if you're planning <Music/Noise> comments or selling through Amazon FDA or for example doing a Kickstarter campaign for some physical product idea that you have to get the ins and outs of that situation with a good fren of mine Richie Norton who was introduced to me by a good friend of ours Johnny Dumas from here on fire Richie and Jon worked together to launch and produce what's <Music/Noise> become a very popular journal now kind of a workbook called the Freedom <Music/Noise> also heard of the Mass Street Journal which John also polished Richie was a major component of that situation <Music/Noise> success so I've invited Richie on today to talk about this whole process of everything from <Music/Noise> manufacturing and shipping in <Music/Noise> you know how this it's just such an interesting conversation so whether you plan on doing physical products or not I'm actually undergoing an experiment myself right now with with physical product to hear more about that in a little bit but whether <Music/Noise> are going to <Music/Noise> the industry or not it's really interesting <Music/Noise> this all works and what can be done and what's possible to open your eyes to certain things that you might be seeing <Music/Noise> day so let's not wait <Music/Noise> Richie Norton from proud proud product together proud at come and also the author of The Tale of the power of starting something stupid and will talk about why that's the name in with me what it means in the NHL here's Richard Norton was so excited to be here <Music/Noise> they are really excited grateful to be here that you're the man in a year <Music/Noise> helped me quite a bit and I'm so excited to dive into a number of different things today as many people never <Music/Noise> the show right now this is sort of physical product month if you will in SP I knew help me alot already with my approach to my physical product experiment <Music/Noise> but first of all you also wrote this amazing book that's getting rave reviews it's called The Power of starting something stupid and I'll Swan dive into that as well but before all this I just wanna say again thank you and tell us how you got to wear out like this year one or two minute origin story like where did where did which Norton <Music/Noise> in it come from and how did you become an expert in all the stuff I won the stupidest one of all that's for sure or I And this or that all was a kid I asked my dad I want to get this idea he said is the worst thing I could say that maybe the best thing he's like you don't want a job I'm sixteen years old and my dad saw me not to get Mike was wrong with you Dad I want to make money that's not Dad's arms as they say that he said no if you work all summer with minimum wage whatever you're not going to make any money he said go tell from San Diego he says go to El Centro buy watermelons in the watermelon patch that are irregular size because they can't sell them to the grocery stores like OK I like take out the seeds in our minivan and we fill up my brother fill it with watermelons to the point where the cars like a full on Low Rider and I sell them on the fourth of July and make more money in one day that I would made the whole summer and so I realize they never trade my time for money everything changed so since then my first as I was in college I met this family from Mongolia I know like I got my star in real business in outer Mongolia sarcasm or company they're getting involved more with stuff in China and then as things go on internet becomes more popular eyes are getting into books online courses training speaking in addition to the physical products of that idea and how long <Music/Noise> this for like the online stuff about ten years more or less in the way every G I got connected with Ashley threw me to find ours Johnny Dumas who you own now and John is the very highly of Richie and I connected with them after that because it's you help John <Music/Noise> his stuff you might talk a little bit about what you done for him yet so podcasting I'm not there I don't have my own podcast yes I'm going to do it when I'm on a lot of podcasts is changed everything because it's a great way to reach people with a great message and it's usually beneficial for the listeners and so <Music/Noise> had me on his podcast basically happen is a listener of his inner reader of mine introduced us so I got his podcast at the end he asked something like what you like your next big thing well I have this company called proud that we held on for years source things from China because Allie Bob is not as are the best way to go in a week later and he's like really talking about that cool idea for the freedoms or no I explained to him how easy and or difficult it's going to be and I met with in San Diego and then we went from there so we help them he wrote the book he did everything he's amazing and we basically put the whole package together in sia everything from having him physically make it sip it organized or three of the warehousing and whereas ultimately does the fulfillment we helped orchestrate that part of it while he went off and did an amazing cakes are that four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in thirty three days and then <Music/Noise> on to the master journal which is crushing it to <Music/Noise> the rest is history yes yes absolutely <Music/Noise> the company your company's name is proud docked <Music/Noise> write what you say that's not a random accent you have like no its product its proud products are proud of proud of and having that domain is available and I'm like school are so proud to come proud U C T <Music/Noise> it too because you want to make a price that you can be proud <Music/Noise> that the more likely it is <Music/Noise> that's just common business mindset as <Music/Noise> speaking of that I want to talk about physical products help jail the help me live <Music/Noise> as some sort of consultation and connect me with the right people and at the time of this recording and still write and think it actually Richie I don't know if you even know but I <Music/Noise> collected a number of beta users who are going to be starting to use prototype versions of our calendars for the project and then it's going <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> sort of you know then we're going to Chinatown stuff but I love I think I saw something damn stories picture a little video of something I was like well he's making stuff happen I as at that school at school I know a lot of people the either have a business online <Music/Noise> which is doing fantastic and are doing courses <Music/Noise> stuff other people they want to start a business but it makes sense for the solutions they want to build to build a physical product and so the first question to ask you is What are the things that somebody needs to really consider before even making its decision to go into the physical product because it's neat to me it's not as <Music/Noise> OK Emma sat for an un teachable or something and seven on a course and then drive people into that I mean <Music/Noise> more to us the rundown on what what we need to know before we get into this cake I cut through all the fat just tell you exactly say what not to do and what to do what not to do is I think the U haf to do and be everything OK because if you're like I want to sell it to say which it I want to sell physical widget what many people think is now I have to learn how to make prototype then I had to learn how to manufacture it that I have to learn how to shift it warehouse that deliver it ends up happening is that process could cost them millions <Music/Noise> of dollars for example is in the manufacturing think of as the products they may contact me as I inherited some money and they wanted to sell organic chocolate and I'm like cool and there first thing was I It's been a million <Music/Noise> on a building I'm like I <Music/Noise> just look up private label chocolate bars and like let's have these done tomorrow to start selling brother yeah so you'll have to do everything they're people who are experts you have to be the master at orchestrating the whole thing right have any idea that is something that sell able make a consumable to the person trying to sell it ok that said you have to be everything because what happens is when you realize you have to be everything and it cost money and time just doing nothing exactly it's too big I will do I retired a million dollars yeah right you're never going to write for the action takers are tough right now here's what you do honestly I make this a try to make this so simple you have an idea for a physical product obviously Google it and if possible find it or something similar to it on Amazon find it like find your copy them not going to steal it you want <Music/Noise> it looks like and hummus are selling for because that's kind of the benchmark now you can assign a price higher lower I mean that's another whole story Bekah not want to know where it's at so the price in this thing it's a thirty bucks we have to assume there's all these in the middle how much they make this thing for Megan for a dollar five dollars ten dollars and then you can work backwards so if you're doing completely on your own I know hard on Alibaba that you could start there or global sources as other websites do but you will find this thing there is <Music/Noise> that thing and they're out there mean like somebody is creating meth in manufacturing it someone in China I mean ninety nine point five percent of the time and <Music/Noise> inside a clothing maybe can be somewhere else that usually <Music/Noise> stuff is tight now it's a lot of time and you would go to the alley or <Music/Noise> mention in <Music/Noise> as their alley the dot com It is for doing on your own not using a service like my mom or global sources dot com Those are my go to websites and a go there you type in i ok I'd type in fly fishing rod is a very tough yes they go we actually have a fly fishing to me by the way so the eye and you do it anyways so that you figure this out and you're like whoa there's all this stuff people are making and you know what they're probably not me might probably can tell you the brands that are using it but I'll tell you this I've been into fly fishing ride manufacturing place in the booties since I like booties booties beneath all the way make the reels on like this stuff and I'm like a Beacon to test these out in this as not is no rivers there's no way to go my way how do you know these things work and they said we don't we have no idea which is make what you guys tell us to make em like Oh that makes sense in that sense you to understand when you go to some like China if you tell them to make it wrong they will make it wrong because they don't know <Music/Noise> they care they want to make it right for you that's where it gets tricky because you might not know the thickness of the material is being used by that slices on Amazon because Amazon with a link it might tell you exactly what it's made at or close to it so you now have a starting point and if they don't tell you exactly what its mean you can literally <Music/Noise> that link to someone <Music/Noise> that's going to make it for you and there so I was in one we were at one factory were like making a skateboard helmets the little plastic of the helmet we went like this is he like put her fingers I and she says she says <Music/Noise> and a letter like what what what does that mean he said Oh that's the name of this type of plastic like she knew the number and letter of the material just by touching it how experts are experts tell you I get close to see send the link of what you want you're not going to copy it you're not going to steal a lot going there but it's a starting point and they can look at and they can go oh yeah we are to make that one or they'll say Yeah we can make that that point that's worth nothing tricky because you'll understand maybe you do like them when you contact someone in America it's like Yeah well you're done in whatever in China is getting hit by Americans are getting hit by every single country in the world every day and they don't know if you're real they don't know if you're a cop competitor they don't know if you're trying to get a free sample which happens every single day to them they don't know so they are throwing out some crazy <Music/Noise> to see if you know what you're talking about so they might say this is real is thirty bucks and if you say yes oh they know that you're an idiot and they're going to there is still the deal you they're going to take you for everything that has seen yet because now I'm telling this story because this actually happened I'm looking at are real and Mike is no brand on it like this thing looks really expensive there sunday thingy for like ten bucks not a joke is like going to Amazon right here in Zion they call it ya Amazon or they <Music/Noise> differently but I go into it and someone selling it on Amazon and eBay for three hundred dollars and I'm like but at the brand on the exact exact thing when I realize the brand is what sinus on this <Music/Noise> like search I'm looking at another real less the same <Music/Noise> with no brand on it and it's like fifty bucks in the comments on our This one is fake don't buy them like actually I the same exact day I so like tips and tricks that kind where you start but at some point you guys know what your quantity when you need to buy houses the shipping cost because the numbers will change if you want to buy a hundred they probably will even talk to you because they have maybe they will but they have the other opportunity costs that are shut down their line to make your thing for only a hundred the real costs are in like getting it started to get going it's not and just shooting off at her because yours is unique so they want to do bulk and so played in the smallmouth or largemouth bass with the Nikkei negotiations come into play and that's why products anybody can buy anything online great it's a concierge service they were like hey we zealously tiny as we go to trial we know we're talking about the good Alibaba you're probably not talking to manufacture anyways his own English there probably is the owner <Music/Noise> or the college girl in turn I just learn English and has no idea what's going on has asked her boss anyways so we come in and were like Hey we know the game were in USA this there's that does respect them it's all about that one key thing the relationships and the other day with us you get the best Apostle even better <Music/Noise> own but if you are doing a little plug for myself but when you could do it on your own that would be the process Kyle back and forth make sure it's real good sample test day and then go to town negotiating team orders maze you want ok let's go back to their real not real Arielle was a real example but it's also a real example when they found Amazon for three hundred <Music/Noise> for fifty because it was not branded the real story and I like it was insane ok so if if if I find that I mean is that a sign that that's a good opportunity <Music/Noise> that because it's only being sold for ten or like I mentioned <Music/Noise> not stealing <Music/Noise> in which you're not because they're just pulling <Music/Noise> but there's this big grand there that you said was already selling for three hundred why even <Music/Noise> route in first place or can you change it or you go so the thought of a second so people who are hearing is probably super confused right now because was a knock off was that not what is it so be careful but one thing happens in America are only good in America your passion is for America not the whole world so recognize that but once you take something for the country bringing into America where there is a pattern or copyright wherever it might be now you might be infringing so there's that second thing is that's kind of the mess is that size is knocking everybody off is not true it's or neighbor who sees your cool thing called sign and says my neighbors making it to make it to China isn't don't care there's going to make what you want it's your neighbor rips you off I know as a mother say that there are knock us out there aren't really for really huge brand name things for stuff they unite be creating some was going to rip it off it's going to be your neighbor and they're going ass tired to make it theirs that in this example that real was made by the manufacturer they own the rights to an hr and went there and said We like that one will you put our logo on it yet that's why we made it so in that case the thing is a kind exclusive agreement to manufacture can sell that seem real to everyone and now is the brand game right and that's that now if you were to go and say if that if that real was proprietary in some way like it's unique to them a really good manufacturer would not even shown it to me Rye and that you wouldn't see what's called a mold like how they actually create it none of that would be happening so that we have to be careful to a sometimes there's many factors that don't care but most of them the good ones you would never see that the end of the day yes great deal buy thing for ten dollars every day sell for thirty forty fifty or whatever <Music/Noise> and let people know you can literally <Music/Noise> guys this is the same thing that brand is doing I don't play that game or not you can say this is not some kind of knock off you can compare this test it thirty Day Money Back guarantee you know all the stuff you normally to sell it yeah that's a fantastic deal could you take something like that and say <Music/Noise> what I really like Israel obviously has big brands using it I would like to see an extra gear <Music/Noise> of an additional extra space to do something with their <Music/Noise> island percent ok so that so that's one thing go to Amazon As You Go There You Go I like this but I want to have this material this these colors on this added on I am not a lawyer I'm not like I know ANYTHING about every industry but there is a percentage might be twenty or Sam or less depends that something's different I'm not a legal person at a certain point if yours is different enough from something it's original it's not infringing I think it is different so there's that so here lies about that in the eat sign hundred percent find something tell me why this much different and go to town I mean that's what people do all along ok so now instead of going in and maybe maybe don't start <Music/Noise> finally you have an idea for a physical price on similar like my calendar <Music/Noise> which was initially she was just going to be a calendar <Music/Noise> it's a calendar <Music/Noise> a workbook for specific goals which is really cool it's actually really excited about it but initially we had talked about just the calendar right and I have presented the idea of the county I want <Music/Noise> interesting fun ways to keep track of certain things that <Music/Noise> different projects you know all of the same time in different ways to sort of show that on the counter so you know this isn't something that anybody's ever created so if you're coming up with something like that we can't go to a main factor doesn't that because that doesn't exist yet and that realm how do you start so a couple things are i e can just go to someone's him a kiss for me unless somehow miraculously is manufacturer has no engineer on board oh that's a whole separate thing that's kind of a nightmare to work is it could work as they say there's a possibility that could happen meaning they <Music/Noise> I could take your ID and it for you that's a possibility it's possible it's possible but rare ok it's really hard because even with all or expertise I'll be completely honest and email or phone call doesn't always translate perfectly from English to Chinese I had some flight you have to get back and go back and forth like that just part of it now so let's say you're in whatever country you're from we're America so you know fortunately <Music/Noise> like IT engineer ml engineers on hand but but but but I think because you're cool because you like an architect guy you can trust you can do things I want to see the person has no idea what to do of course with Google but at some point you have to somehow get the idea out of your head and onto paper whether it's a drawing or writing writing it down as the first at the second step is to talk to someone that could Haas a bully either make it or are pointing the right direction with what you did I And I'm like you know like make and I didn't know it was our talking like Oh I have this guy think he can do this and so at that point is really hard was it made as in so it depends if it's a piece of clothing or fabric I promise you there is someone even a freelancer online on work or wherever that will make you that thing same deal and scared all the awesome freelance websites all that stuff there is <Music/Noise> who's an ex read this and make it for you for a decent price even if it's a three D molding model thing <Music/Noise> it can happen then once he was in a cause that what the heck you're doing right but then once it's done you have that this whole thing in your hand this is the prototype essentially is the prototype and you're looking at here like this is not what I thought it would be okay or this is awesome or let's change it once you get that right and then us scale you should start means try and get quotes locally the oh how the shipping cost of things like that all tell you this I tried to get quotes and people who tried to unfortunately knock off like what Johnny Dumas is doing this is his book with the leather super fancy like this they're people I try to close in America has tried to see to see and I can tell you is costly will tell you that I have heard people tell me in America we can not make this it's to custom and I've had other who called means I try to tie the knot was doing they told me to be eighty dollars a book this is not a joke and I'm like what I <Music/Noise> so sometimes it makes sense to go overseas let's be honest so that when you want to scale you can send them prototype to them and they can reverse engineer it like once there they are magic they're so good at copying and doing exactly what you want a deal trying to get and understand what you are from your head is really impossible right once they have it game over or I then sent away you know how that made you know to scale yeah I mean in May in a in my calendar projects before the War Party came into play and I had a chat with you and I had a chat with an engineer friend that you point me to We <Music/Noise> long phone call about what this thing was going to be like and how is going to work and we came to conclusion to test our first prototype run in person three D printed some of it and <Music/Noise> one version of it and <Music/Noise> was like on wooden had plastic parts and Elise all these pieces into it and it works the way I had described but then when I was actually playing with it like this This is going to be cumbersome and are so many pieces here just as accents because what <Music/Noise> to happen is have specific colors that you could pick out that were clearly can put on top of the specific date CLC with what it was but you can start to color match like what's happening in Landon was really cool idea <Music/Noise> but then when I saw it being played out <Music/Noise> like baggy of all these different pieces like this is just Lego with happy I mean people are going to lose these things or step on them or maybe kids will choke on em or something so I came back I needed that prototype though in order to make those decisions it was super handy and I learned a lot and that's that's the whole purpose of prototype but if I get to the point where OK it's ready to go then i call or find <Music/Noise> China it's locally doesn't make sense to just have to send it to them or like Is that safe like sending a prototype like the only <Music/Noise> and then <Music/Noise> I I would start with pictures of course you know like pictures pictures pictures if they required actual product I would get a new you to make a second one I and hopefully the second one is less expensive than the first never know it again depends because I might have been done at cos my favor but supposedly the second one will have less time put in to its already there the first line I mean coming up with the As you've got a lot of work to dry then put in the CAD designer at its work was done it's done you can print it again which is never OK but whether it's safe to say in your second prototype design or not is obviously debatable xx likely rip it off will they do this and I will say you will <Music/Noise> actually happening you don't realize this because the area is getting there like saying why we even need someone <Music/Noise> what to make and then we sell it to the <Music/Noise> manufacturer spotlight wholesale and then they resell it a lot of are saying screw my own <Music/Noise> companies to brand them to whatever country you <Music/Noise> and you don't even know yours by say three to manufacture you don't even now it's happening all day long on Amazon as it gets up in the mail from Asia they know that's happening a lot in terms of finding a supplier meet Asher would be best to say that start with your network if you have somebody who can kind of pressure and then and then know this is my personal opinion first all piracy them security I mean am I afraid someone's going to rip you off and so instead you do nothing or so to anyone you have nothing anyways it's better to like take the risk that someone's going to steal your stuff in my opinion because in reality they're probably not going to steal a few off but it is better to try and have them or even often than not try it all came at least my personal opinion <Music/Noise> with that I mean this is what I talk been a vocal of I like when you have an idea share it with people because that feedback you get from people's much more valuable and then the con side of it which is maybe <Music/Noise> could take that idea <Music/Noise> instrument to do it so Yeah yeah so if USA and your fear was there to steal my butt off I guess it's a possibility it's very low because it was a new product they don't want to rip anything off it as Artie how the market I like a favorite there because of a largely self and say like it is probably not going to happen so you should feel okay like making this thing saying oh they're taking that risk and do every can make you happy in being the first market may be secondary guy do to get this thing done is way more important than the fear of everyone ripping off because yeah even if your neighbor did pick it up to twenty percent either thing that could happen anywhere anytime yes I mean happens every day so it is part of the world unfortunately athlete is but if you play the game got to play the game ok so have another entire <Music/Noise>"
"11","Smart Passive Income Podcast","271_An_Interview_with_Five-Minute_Journal_Founders_UJ_Ramdas_and_Alex_Ikonn.mp3","having a podcast with that plane session number two hundred and seventy one by the way to think in the The Welcome <Music/Noise> Income podcast <Music/Noise> working hours <Music/Noise> so you <Music/Noise> back and read <Music/Noise> and now <Music/Noise> over again Kate starts <Music/Noise> and that <Music/Noise> but fled in the Hey what's up everybody thank you so much for joining me today in a session of the Smart passive Income podcasts really thankful you're here and actually take a moment just express my gratitude for you for listening <Music/Noise> for the Z have left for abuse that is the who have subscribed a I truly truly mean that that relates to today's episode which is an interview with two amazing people EJ in Alex the founders of a tool they use every single day when I wake up in the morning and when I go to bed and that is the five minute journal this is something you may have heard me talk about before but this is something that I use every single day like I said so when I wake up i open this journal it's right there on my nightstand I write in it and what it does is it prophecy with a few questions <Music/Noise> one being What are you thankful for life and everyday we wake up like that it really sets the tone for the rest of the time that you're awake but even before you go to bed he come back to this journal right before you go to sleep and you talk about the great things that happened during the day and it's just three lines and also what's one thing you wish you would have done better and just doing this exercise <Music/Noise> change in my life in my mood and in what I get done and it's an amazing way to stay productive but also just remember about you know even though things may not always be great there are things to be grateful for and I just want to start the show to express my gratitude toward you but also set you up for this interview because Eugene Alex our amazing <Music/Noise> and we get into the story about how this journal came about I'll say dive into <Music/Noise> get this thing built and how they market it and what has happened since then we also get into a little bit of the science behind why expressing gratitude is important and I believe it's one of the most important things in the world this is a very common trait between all successful launch been yours or <Music/Noise> at least is they take time to reflect on what's amazing and I recommend that <Music/Noise> in the Jane Alex give you a little bit of a challenge <Music/Noise> well very simple to do but not easy to implement and by the way if you are a part of my book club which you can find at Pat's book Love dot com you will have <Music/Noise> that I have given away copies of the five minute journal before and I may just give away a few copies after this episode so make sure you stick around and listen all the way through I have a giveaway for you at the end for a few lucky winners and then finally sit back relax and <Music/Noise> with Hugh Jay and Alex from intelligent Change dot com and co founders of the five minute journal whatever I <Music/Noise> happy to welcome you Jay and Alex to the spy passing camp I guess the guys behind the five minute journal welcome to the show thank you both for being here we're really grateful to be here so we'll go one by one actually for each <Music/Noise> what you guys did before us came of this idea and <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> get started and just talk about kind of where like what you do before focusing on fine internal I know people change here clinic for Beaver chainsaws to help people get from point A to Point B with specific strategies <Music/Noise> actually move the needle because I think the market for that and I really care about people making real change and of those was part of my work before getting the fiber channel that's going to get to see ties in perfectly for went to find a journal became Alex tell you <Music/Noise> before finding eternal life crucify monitor on me my wife Mimi I find I would run a business a look see Aaron's the e commerce beauty business okay that's cool and I'm curious Alex if you can continue with Okay where did this idea if I'm in a journal cover and you actually know you day before this idea came about is actually a really great story I think the way you did that we may yet have a couple years of prior to the image or idea and you actually approach me because we are at an event a few years back and then he approached me because you are looking to start kind of lifestyle design business for work weeks in Paris at the time that's what I was doing with the businesses can use and <Music/Noise> out of the blue approached me said Hey I want to have a business like you have can help me and I'm like You're crazy and what a healthy and at the same time we had mutual interest and I said OK I'll go for coffee leads me to we met up and right away like OK this guy's very eccentric his little weird but he's very interesting and he's very into self help manner as I am and a lot of mutual trust and just be friends with others the meat from the time I said I can really help you create a business because I really believe him now specially about that time creating a business that you're fully aligned with the product is really resonate with who you <Music/Noise> try to make money just for money savings at the point after after myself just make the money isn't going to make a more fulfilled I think being a business that is tied with your purpose will provide you a lot more value than just having the money come in so that's the kind of how we met and how we pursued the idea from a journal and I guess the two are going to use the story of how the image or idea she was created an entry should <Music/Noise> are curious in terms of a cable like hindsight <Music/Noise> come about sometimes it was like right away and neither would continue our ducks in a park for four to five hours we have really become if that's all for some growth that we just read <Music/Noise> what each one of us was doing to help us just live our best lives and use as she hadn't but she is now an incredible incredible journey leads technique where you journal for like an hour two hours a day will dance like different journaling is for different results John for different results and so too is in the evening I had a practice where I answered about four to six questions that sometimes it took me longer to really get help help me get a strong <Music/Noise> of how the day go because I came across a really great quote that I think it isn't our job right now which is how you live your days is how you live your lives and it hit me because at the time I <Music/Noise> the way I want to live my life and oh so once I get every twenty four hours in the days to say yes twenty four hours what happened and I was talking to Alex about this and and be taught in gratitude and storing the morning the gratitude of the time to start his mornings with gratitude walks with me and to talk my habits and behavior and businesses in an ox like cute but we <Music/Noise> notebook helps people do this because nobody's going to do this though is that as you are going to get some supper at a book that house it much easier to help people to do it and and we just shook hands right there that's only because I just thought that uses being a yes with the best evening portion was probably fifteen to twenty minutes <Music/Noise> than twenty thirty average probably about fifty to sixty minutes a day and a very intense the journaling says that said you did this is great I would love to introduce my life but I wanted this in like five minutes a day and we also talked about this many how many self help books or self growth books whatever you call them bee hive all these great tips what to your life or you know there's also a great book at that time came out was Happiness advantage Bosh on a Harvard professor and yet where he did all these great studies of what gratitude can do to your overall well being or journaling <Music/Noise> affirmations or just all the stuff with actual signed by the proof that these things work but is all these books you read them but what about the follow through how to actually implement all these things into your daily life and that's where BJ came together because at that time like I said before our wee man really was it was usually looking for that news for that idea to create a business and I said well we have to wait until the right idea comes out and when we kind of we're talking about the This Is It This is the idea that can help us actually bring this gap and actually create a product the value and most importantly I was excited about this usually is a site about this because this <Music/Noise> would actually want to have in <Music/Noise> and use that will help us live better lives that's how I really believe the best products we started something that you want to have in your lives because I had a successful business prior <Music/Noise> will just use this five original idea as a way to help us launch a business <Music/Noise> and but it's really to help you understand how to create a business from scratch so I hope you and take you through this process of what it takes to create a lifestyle business and with this product and that's really how it started and we sold <Music/Noise> thousand units elsewhere goes <Music/Noise> but in reality I don't really care because I just wanted to have this product my life because I want to use it and practice it because I knew the power of design daily basis especially in writing because as you gay priests to mention my biggest thing that has changed my life the most in a meeting prior to the farmer drove to become financially successful in the pen of three was really the power of gratitude and it was really that simple habit you know yes we did the grads who walks in that tier of the sauce that but sometimes when my tendons cold I want to offer gratitude wash my school <Music/Noise> good at it so I just thought of as when I wake up the first thing that many do my habit of just think of the things I'm grateful for even be one thing and it took some time to get that habit but eventually I did and so that as soon as I woke up I just think of the first thing that great before and even just that one single habit is a hinge to anybody right now <Music/Noise> five hundred during the night that if you just install one habit right and that it is that is the habit of gratitude and just try to use up when you wake up in the morning just think of one thing I knew before <Music/Noise> off the debt credit to the end with the reason I challenge you to do that and you'll see that actually it's fairly challenging to re <Music/Noise> brainy to Ashley automatic think like this will take some time and that's why we all scream if I murder of that how can we create something that is kind of your buddy you know a certain way to help you guide through this process on a daily basis to help you really re wire brain and your thought process to help you think us with that way because the truth is many of us artists have really been we have created <Music/Noise> thought habits through media through school if their parents a lot of negativity and and that's what happens is a lot of us have that negative voice in our heads so how do you overcome the negative boys how to create new thought patterns and we really thought the merger is going to be the way to help people do that most appalling held us to that but I'm curious there's a lot of different parts to this but it's not just about gratitude which is obviously the most important thing I found and now just being conscious about gratitude When think before has massively change my oil field alley on life my mood to start the day and I think that's even for a love that challenge he gave to everybody to just wake up and start thinking about that right away actually fun fact that my kids school they do gratitude practices at my son's school to stem schools an awesome school yeah <Music/Noise> school it's got me <Music/Noise> all these other kinds of things that are benefiting benefiting is on you and how I can incorporate them into school so <Music/Noise> what age are at this kind of thing is really important and I'm curious though because like I'm looking at the book I love how it's not just like you know blank pages throughout the whole thing is like instructions there's science behind either stuff and I love that you put that there but there's more than just thinking about what you're thankful for there's also you know saying affirmations and the Ok will check in with yourself an eye and ask yourself OK well <Music/Noise> you would <Music/Noise> what do you wish you'd done better I would love to know the story about OK how this got structured the way it did and and because obviously you're telling a story asserts that the Battier and that's where it starts every single day but how is all this other stuff kind of put in <Music/Noise> different iterations <Music/Noise> model things that happen to get to where it's at now <Music/Noise> to start and take take that yes so of buses comes from positive psychology research in so I thought to actually do something <Music/Noise> about as Alex is talking is something that I think Chris are formed and do really like angry about something something that really bothers me is there's a <Music/Noise> we know so many tech stocks unhappy and books and stuff but there's <Music/Noise> of it and I was seeing that time in the work of young people and it was popular and it was bothering me that was a structure for applying these things in any consistent way and pas ecology was basically the idea that we can learn from people who have incredibly positive lies we can learn from people so typically the way that psychology is to have <Music/Noise> ago we took <Music/Noise> depression and needs to be like how we get people out of this which is not the ideal place to start don't want to learn <Music/Noise> from homeless person to whom <Music/Noise> rich rich person just so and then it took for some reason the nineteen eighties for the whole world psychology cum that fact and there's been very <Music/Noise> twenty thirty years about how to do this in the practice of gratitude is the very top something <Music/Noise> question you read on there is no baked a great and this is actually my third question <Music/Noise> the priming question and the Casa de from your brain Pat say you buy a new core book junk or I to do okay with the car the Tesla acts fantastic ok so you deftly when you were driving <Music/Noise> and that has liked especially when you started I bet you noticed every other test lehx around yeah absolutely <Music/Noise> I just ask the question <Music/Noise> its band has has some sort of name to forget the name but it's Sam and Charlie for John on Twitter here anyway has its particular activities yet are young yet so what the reason that works is because when you're in that corridor you brain is primed to notice these things around you the scores were likely already there you distort its noticed a very similar it's been proven that when you look forward to a positive experience in your day a large part of the happiness is actually the anticipation last even before I got the car knowing that it was like it was coming because with Tess is yet to order them had a timer <Music/Noise> like in June and had <Music/Noise> for it during that <Music/Noise> would spot every single test Landon <Music/Noise> about being <Music/Noise> absolutely right in Seoul the coop or is everybody who does the time a journal everyday you have that experience everyday and be good engineer that just asking yourself what would make today great because when they ride down there anticipating actually doing those things and in part the day and just the act of writing it down physically and spitting that improves happiness powerful powerful exercise the third questions about affirmations the daily affirmations and awe do you really powerful <Music/Noise> in English <Music/Noise> I am and whatever comes after that and the reason for that <Music/Noise> high today about by just building on us strong and consistent work ethic and what it does is it allows <Music/Noise> to strengthen a Porter dedicate our behaviors are correspond to the identity that we think we are if you think your cause or person and you write that down it's like a drop in the bucket over time your cursor to build a lot of strength in that belief and it just becomes part of what's been your experiences question I mean it's it's it's always one that confirms <Music/Noise> healthy and firm like who I <Music/Noise> to be in and <Music/Noise> to become I often use it to strengthen the values <Music/Noise> them on but I also use it to help me get to where I want to go as well for the first three questions credit to the priming and the affirmations us the first part of the five original <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> a five or journals or teacher might write something <Music/Noise> to something you do before you go to bed and helps move through the negative thoughts it kind of cleans away the cobwebs <Music/Noise> so he can remain sharp and if you'll feel great how <Music/Noise> did you have to go to of different versions of the book before you <Music/Noise> all out on to be counted I remember <Music/Noise> there being like straw conversations and important <Music/Noise> the content <Music/Noise> the quality of the book and she <Music/Noise> but I mean in terms of the continent a book how many <Music/Noise> before <Music/Noise> on something while we're still changing <Music/Noise> once in awhile the core <Music/Noise> very much I just I think huge and I knew the kind of questions <Music/Noise> to be in there and we knew <Music/Noise> from <Music/Noise> that we've both done together that these are very powerful questions and this is while so we have the introductory pages and description of how to approach each question it's very important because even for example the question What makes a great yarn around it oh I hope it's sunny like the London Eye can expect that to be sunny I can't do do anything about that best explains the people that when you write that you write it from the things that you cash impact and and how to do in your life so for me for example living in London I can't really control the weather or what I can control is the same thing like I'll go for run today and was saying that what I'm doing is I'm overcoming resistance and is <Music/Noise> maybe I would like to do but when Ash she write that down there's more chance of that happening and when Ashley doing that's why we'll see how the course and the evening which reaffirms the question is what three amazing things that happened today and those that evening portion helps us to reaffirm not only other new spontaneous things that happen throughout the day but also maybe the thing they have set out resulted in <Music/Noise> that you all is complete and I and the good <Music/Noise> ones where I used a three million to three will make a great and will see list three things and even portion she knocked out all three will allow the Great Basin <Music/Noise> and you go to bed happy <Music/Noise> happy you wake up n happy races amazing feedback to say I love that you include his questions and there was that kind of structure like that from the start before he started manufacturing <Music/Noise> that you kind of added later I mean it sounds like the kind of knew already the plan here to kind of achy ankle we had a pretty strong <Music/Noise> of looking back it's incredible that we're actually pretty aligned on on the product pretty early <Music/Noise> quick few details that we went back and forth on but the main bones of it was pretty free set did you test it with anybody before Hodges internal testing which is Try to ourselves and I would like to mention that as I sat in the beginning we're really creating this product for ourselves as a wee one of the Swiss Re the approach of business I think it is sissy you are away a sample of them all of the market and we knew that if we would enjoy <Music/Noise> product we knew it but other people like us would enjoy using as well and it's interesting because when people look at five in a draw now <Music/Noise> like This is so simple and especially now it's very kind of on trend of these journals <Music/Noise> of think we see when <Music/Noise> we started in a way that trend for these kind of journals that time there was no like why would I buy a journal that is pre filled out where I'm going to fill in my Stuff like to think about that we do we start to actually one of the reasons once again is that it's kind of my design aesthetic sense of mine because <Music/Noise> like well you had those journalists get nose like so much <Music/Noise> you distill it out but is still messy and the UGA <Music/Noise> that through our other products that were created of like the product of the planner although I can view to my own journal our life when things are very put together in a very aesthetic may look nice in it feel nice to actually want to use every bit his cell <Music/Noise> its great qualities <Music/Noise> like I I love the feel of it it becomes a <Music/Noise> ritual are and <Music/Noise> know it's I put on my nightstand or so is the first thing I do in the last thing I do and is it looks nice there it's not like you said not messy so I know a lot of quality way into I love this stamp name of it if I'm in turn on top which wants me to begin exploring the sort of okay this is a physical product I mean yes because of its idea I mean you could obviously turn into something digital eye and I believe you guys do have an app for it for people who don't get the physical book but I would highly recommend getting a physical because they're just like you said something with actually running it down I want to know what the thought process was and the journey through actually getting this thing created I want to <Music/Noise> Alex you're just talking when we continue with you talk about <Music/Noise> ok first steps they took to actually get this thing built yeah I think the way we approach that is once again as I said is we want to use everyday and you Jane <Music/Noise> to say bookstores and Tron Canada and we were going to we just look into products that we like and we would go through we look at how he just tells what kind of picture we wanted to use and we kind of collaboration and kind of put pieces together to the final thing and then <Music/Noise> work directly with the manufacturers we said this is what we want we want linen cover because it feels luxurious and it's very natural at the same time we don't want things like that especially when you have a product by about side you want something that's cozy you want something that's you know some people do you hug it <Music/Noise> is a search to search for the <Music/Noise> best just a friend that is applying it against their cheeks just because they love the way it feels <Music/Noise> its prey and I didn't <Music/Noise> win but what is weird <Music/Noise> like these are things that we look at because once again when you design stuff that you want to have in <Music/Noise> you look like what I like what do I enjoy and yes a kind of go through those things and so the process it was really just kind of you know it when you probably may be ordered Tesla you had a good opportunity to choose the kind of you know in Sera had or the color of the car was right and when you create a product I love about creating party I think cream pie was one of the bests like process is out there what it is because you get to choose all these features they'd like you know what kind of paper you want to use fonts that you want to use what was it was a picture can be lag and all these things was that age setting <Music/Noise> and how's going to be laid out and for me <Music/Noise> that this <Music/Noise> funnest parts of the product creation and probably one of the most enjoyable parts and I think what we're putting together <Music/Noise> thinking how can we make this product stand out how how can we make multiple Lee ourselves enjoy the product but also how can we make sure that others will also enjoy this product on their daily use because this <Music/Noise> on a daily basis have you have to like it if you get to be something <Music/Noise> for every day well you're the fallout have it pretty quickly in and are really our main goal is How can we help you get this habit into your daily life that can help you transform your life can change a life as it has done for us that now it when you finally go to bookstores and you kind of feel Ani like ok to be like this it's unlikely like this this material again would you go from there yea like how did you find a manufacturer to put that together feeling was that process like well you know this part of the process but the elbow of stuff the season tallied up to him and looked at several sentences <Music/Noise> suppliers and went back and forth for some of them some of them have really fast responses and in what they're doing on others really set in a generic responses and didn't really make the cut and <Music/Noise> forth with people as it had a good sense and diverse possums and and in new product <Music/Noise> line Taliban attack <Music/Noise> and then just start making calls yeah and then call us and I think the <Music/Noise> speaking which they use google translate well ah I guess most of all is that you have the ability to with this type of product where it's still not that expensive to order for sample so a full out and this I think the important for anybody who's starting a business it's a team gets the all although it may cost extra before you order a thousand or ten thousand units it's still better to spend that extra money to have a full sample mail out to see how a lookalike and went huge and I went ahead with that first even sample order we said OK we want this first full sample made with even <Music/Noise> like crazy <Music/Noise> right yes we want print on the inside because they can steal and a blank will be more expensive they'll do the whole princess is due to full shebang was the prince thing I think it costs anywhere from three to five hundred dollars for samples more <Music/Noise> we got at least for now but at that time we got it and we look that you don't read if we are in love from the Jewish Shas them you know anybody who has created product or even think about creating products sometimes things do fall in place and went uber you have to have that feeling where you like you know I won out I still write I feel I can bring this in the marketplace and or react well because the So you want to weigh what we want to approach as well if this would sit on bookshelves and the Barnes and Nobles or Indigo there in Canada would look professional and kind of makes other products there and would it even night and as we look professional but would stand out would this be something that people would want to grab two and buy for themselves because if you think about it resell right now"

Erica Baker from The Baker's dot tv so wasn't too long ago on Twitter and on Facebook I had said hey guys do you know any couples or partners who have created a business together and I got <Music/Noise> of suggestions all great actually looked into them the reason for this is because I wanted to know what it was like to interview <Music/Noise> who was working with somebody else in building a business together right for me it's just me and I started this thing on my own I wanted to see what it likes to to to have two people who started something together is of course there are a lot of people who had friends working together they were people who had just business partners to the literally found each other because <Music/Noise> this business together and then they became friends and then there were the bakers acres that TV I had about <Music/Noise> tweets and emails and facebook messages from people who are saying that I had to have the bakers on Brian and Ericka and I followed up an apple wine in these because they're so <Music/Noise> because they're so transparent so with a dual at the Baker's that TV they help people make sense <Music/Noise> and they do this by connecting truly a very transparent and authentic way with their audience and they built this massive crowd of raving fans by doing so through a number of different channels specifically Live streams for a lot of things and <Music/Noise> if they're going through a fighter something they share in the talk about communication and they've really built a lot of trust over time with their audience <Music/Noise> of course being a husband wife combo they built this business that they now have together they also have really smart ways of actually getting people on their email listening and they're talking about relationships and communication and we talk alot about that in this episode to say not just how they started their business together but also I want to gain some tips from them in terms of OK few have a partnership or you're thinking about starting a partnership or no matter what kind of partnership you have even if it's outside of business maybe it's for a relationship that you have with somebody how can you best communicate so that you can work things out and that's where the show will come into play some really excited to feature both Brian Erica Baker from The Baker's dot tv <Music/Noise> let's get right into it everybody and so happy to welcome Brian Erica Baker to the show today Brian Erica thank you so much for being <Music/Noise> has a compact has a hairy guys doing we're doing great thank you for having us absolutely you know <Music/Noise> this question to my audience not too long <Music/Noise> any couples or partners who started their <Music/Noise> together and <Music/Noise> things and I've got a lot of people who answer to this person or this company but I had gotten about fifty different people say you've got to interview Erica and <Music/Noise> and sake dun <Music/Noise> that social proof at its finest right <Music/Noise> get into how that happened in the air when I start with you tell me <Music/Noise> lazy white <Music/Noise> that raving fans right now well we work on lying with men and women with a desire to create easy communication and deep connections <Music/Noise> so <Music/Noise> through our blind we do weekly at least weekly live in these videos on line course we do private coaching and <Music/Noise> great cooking <Music/Noise> he spends wow <Music/Noise> surrounding the idea of just helping his is couples your rabbit are Brian in terms of if you know who <Music/Noise> here on I would sit in those of our followers are on in romantic relationships but we've had a lot of people they reached out to Aston they follow <Music/Noise> and everything in there like a I'm <Music/Noise> right now that things you are sharing are really speaking to me and are preparing you for or on forensic relationship Sunday as well as friendships and work relationships and all that so we kind of switched years to open it up to you on to prepare people for any kind of relationship release him Brian what's the URL where people can find out where you guys are at it because that TV makers dot tv ok Sarah talk about the origin story of the bakers that he <Music/Noise> got started here yet so we always had a desire to serve others and we are most important thing with Brian's background in ministry we knew that there is something that we were meant to do in particular we just never seem to thing and that box that we are always gesture trying to find my car stays and on in corporate world and so we kept searching and just basically doing on personal development trying to figure out you know what gifts we had and finally someone passes away what do people come to you guys nationally for and I that that means Ainge was a relationship coaching or counseling Brown Brian was a pastor for almost five years that's when people started seeking guidance and then <Music/Noise> combining <Music/Noise> on and people <Music/Noise> liked that answer having just one person you're talking about <Music/Noise> or shouldn't do we talked about us from <Music/Noise> quite where we came from we've always struggled with relationships is always struggled with communication <Music/Noise> and how that impacted our <Music/Noise> and quite frankly we <Music/Noise> I was so awful we heard all the time and you know he he would get offended because you feel like I was saying he was due bed and <Music/Noise> was doing and I would then happen then we sat down and I would get offended because you know it was like a vicious cycle and it's just what <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> to dig our way out of that that's that's a habit that we have formed and so we being the people we are to yourself better you know that our selves we and mentors we robots I tried to figure out <Music/Noise> what this looks like for us to have like a real working relationship and communication and it doesn't come natural and you have to work guy and went to <Music/Noise> like we can make this into a rhythm that other people could utilize a swell time that Brian would would you <Music/Noise> email ll la Paz on that topic is just better communication <Music/Noise> and the in a couple minutes can you give <Music/Noise> is going through a had just described <Music/Noise> of that miscommunication <Music/Noise> bitter feelings toward another how can one <Music/Noise> to start or at least put themselves <Music/Noise> the right direction as sort of getting out and starting to communicate better with each other yes I would say a lot <Music/Noise> kind of starts with I'm just kind of discovering who you are so I'm kind of the bases for the issues that you have <Music/Noise> and a lot of times the reasons you're not getting along so we developed something called a corny squares I kind of helps you develop what you need from a relationship so whether that is someone to just let you know I believe <Music/Noise> or <Music/Noise> there for you on so from there on you can kind of figure out what uni and and <Music/Noise> partner your friend your co worker whatever can and that's how you walk through that one from there I would say a HUGE is work on kind of some basic steps and communication so that's that the next thing we <Music/Noise> people through we have on something called six test you easy communication and say it's just starting out and creating <Music/Noise> safe place and Zoe Tay said take a break from each other if you need to feel like a thirty minute breaks the <Music/Noise> eye the <Music/Noise> eye yet taking the space to calm down yes green is kinder to each other <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> gonna re establish the fact that you are there for each other you're on the same team you <Music/Noise> or reason in <Music/Noise> added to the fact that on regard is that we're not on the same page right now we're working towards seeing things and we want to get through this together I love that I think that applies to all kinds of relationships not just romantic ones but friendships and obviously business partnerships to which we're talking a lot about this <Music/Noise> because a lot of people compare business partnerships to well marriages <Music/Noise> hopefully that helps people out or perhaps at this moment going through some tough times and I want to continue <Music/Noise> your story <Music/Noise> of OK you've <Music/Noise> but then you've fought and out of that you need a DD had mentors and coaches and counselors like he said <Music/Noise> then <Music/Noise> we can bring other people along with us and help people and serve <Music/Noise> in and curious were <Music/Noise> of doubts when <Music/Noise> like almost questions like Who <Music/Noise> teach other people's stuff or was it just felt like this calling her or can feel <Music/Noise> just had to do it and either you can take that question I being I were a lot of rumors a few like question themselves constantly high after eighty eight so it's that whole in postures and around and <Music/Noise> to hear more <Music/Noise> Nick Oliva and ninety km even wrote a article on that and it's basically feeling like you're just not good enough to talk about that and we felt that time and I think that we just need to re center ourselves the fact that you even pay honor and say we're not you know certified counselors we didn't get our degrees in psychology but we can bring to the table is our personal experiences and how we were Saran is not going to be the same for everybody but I know a lot of people resonate with us and that's why we've decided to share our journey and we are okay with completely being <Music/Noise> and open about everything I believe we have <Music/Noise> of things that aren't easy to talk about that we've gone to in the past and we've been on welfare if I when we had our first year kids and I was pregnant with our third we actually didn't have jobs or home so <Music/Noise> of things that we've gone through that maybe people can relate to only parts or her story by I just re centering ourselves that we're just telling your story to help encourage people that we do have a way that could possibly how right how did you start telling a story together to the world uh yeah I was seated area connected with Nicole Walters she's always been there has <Music/Noise> eager to you to seek out mentors and find people a day that how <Music/Noise> in so she kind of legal fate and she's like I love because she's amazing <Music/Noise> want her to be in our corner she reached out to Nicole and said how I connected you I become what you are and Nicole reached back and I called her and we are both super excited and I so she has walked us through like so this is what we want to do how do we begin this process how do we turn this into <Music/Noise> a passion but awaits you to change our lives to change other people's lives and to make a business from it on the coals one k One <Music/Noise> I initially <Music/Noise> I having her as <Music/Noise> that's how we started on the journey of like OK taking this passion that we are very <Music/Noise> and you know not sure how to tell or story to you well we have today and that had only started last August while not very long ago I mean that's less than a year ago at this point in coming out of that was the big realization <Music/Noise> what was the kind of aha moments he that came at her and that really helps you get the right foot forward I think a lot of it was the good days on was what we are to mentioned <Music/Noise> just kind of these are the passions that we have <Music/Noise> the things that people are coming to us for we were <Music/Noise> with <Music/Noise> how we find our place and so that's what we decided to step into and how to you and decided to monetize that he was OK to my eyes at but it's okay to <Music/Noise> from something you're passionate <Music/Noise> so had to be how do you even <Music/Noise> what what platforms <Music/Noise> start yes oh how we started I dream that was just Facebook Live videos is our biggest following <Music/Noise> just showing up consistently and listening to our audience and what their wines you hear about and constantly asking them you know what is going on <Music/Noise> that you would want us to talk about and then <Music/Noise> at interacting with them making sure that they understand that they're <Music/Noise> that we do everything and then from there we created I am on line course and dad right now is are mean <Music/Noise> also have a you know affiliates and Amazon <Music/Noise> and you know a person's all of us but we are on MC or six steps to ease the Haitian <Music/Noise> our life coaching and everything is done online so it's at the video that's cool lol If Facebook lively quick tell me about your process for going live Brian like how often you guys go live what's the set up blank as we get a feel for what kind what these interactions like with your audience can definitely say we try to keep it pretty consistent on every <Music/Noise> he sometimes life gets in the way and we both work full time jobs and we have three kids three two <Music/Noise> lot so it doesn't always happen but we try to stay consistent with that and we just use content from the feedback that we've gotten from our followers that things there and that they are struggling with or want to know more about <Music/Noise> as the things they <Music/Noise> from our own relationship and have seen over and over This is a problem <Music/Noise> and these are the ways we have come to a resolution in those areas in and in some of the stuff that we talk about too is the stuff that people are uncomfortable to talk about we decided to try to tackle those in and sit in that country was <Music/Noise> with them because a lot of people wanna know like the fifteen you know best date nights and stuff and we can talk about that war and <Music/Noise> on my finances but you know there's things are topics that people don't wanna talk about like me feeling like you're a horrible parent you know when you're trying to create a business on how to create boundaries when you're building a business between you and your spouse whether they're in the business with you or not which I had actually started a business by myself before we did this one together so we've experienced both sides are even things like um sex from a guy's perspective Brian Ashley was just featured on elephant Journal and fur and blood that he wrote that over ninety four thousand <Music/Noise> on and it's because we're talking about subjects that people are afraid to talk about them and so you're able to build this community and so people are coming <Music/Noise> to you direct them anywhere <Music/Noise> you kind of getting them to come back to the website <Music/Noise> which you know are there any call to actions are we selling <Music/Noise> live <Music/Noise> like walking through sort of you know what happens after the city has done each week on Monday yes there's always a call to action varies week to week and no we are not selling them every time I personally am not a huge fan of that but I do want to make sure they know what resources are <Music/Noise> if they choose to go that way and we also <Music/Noise> e mails with our our blocks and to everybody <Music/Noise> went because we have a weekly poor plot gets released as well time that is derived from our live video as well as quotes and things like that are sent out on our Facebook page throughout the week coral eating with the unit we talk about and so then we had a call to action for them to either the best and everything that they can have access to or on a discount on one or promotion on one of our courses or promotion dine on twenty <Music/Noise> session with eyes I mean there's always something to do and sometimes it's just reading a buck and that we've suggested the call to action and which will have a link on our page for so we're really starting to interview key boss as well during her live videos so that's another way that we've been having people interact with us that circle as you're building this business and <Music/Noise> just kind of taken off now which is fantastic what <Music/Noise> to serve together with the business <Music/Noise> of the way it's growing like Are there any things <Music/Noise> end differently <Music/Noise> any parts that you wish could be done little easier the city is struggling with how it has definitely been schedule especially I mean we talk about artifact that we work full time jobs and three is three under on <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> raising his business so it's taken <Music/Noise> of intentionality to make sure that our kids still had parents say they live and know <Music/Noise> we have to make sure that our <Music/Noise> stays together because if it falls apart the most successful business in the world Anais Nin not worth it in our eyes so we have to make <Music/Noise> make time for each other so for us every Thursday night we just turn off our phones turn off everything in saying I know you're busy <Music/Noise> things we can be doing <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> is it Saturday night so we'll just spend time together check in with each other see how things are going to get some <Music/Noise> I did a nine ball action Thursday night stay with my life <Music/Noise> it's it's it's incredible <Music/Noise> much even just a few hours together <Music/Noise> off like he said is just can to to to reinvigorate the release it to get motivated <Music/Noise> to continue <Music/Noise> an hour and <Music/Noise> dis question <Music/Noise> that's fantastic we actually created a box required disconnect to reconnect box because I was struggling with seeing my phone <Music/Noise> checking it because they know that there is something that honors Monday of the Out Of sight Out of Mind on and so we created the stocks that we know it goes in there can charge was in there and we don't rush it for us than ie and we actually did not know that you had responded to our Twitter verse of the few posts I'm saying <Music/Noise> to set up a times you interact with us an interview us because we're actually on the night in our phones are in our box as so funny when I thought it was holey areas that they all knew before us and we didn't known to the next morning sell well you have an <Music/Noise> talk about them really quick if you can <Music/Noise> on their behalf why <Music/Noise> are raving about what you both do I think it's because they bring an element of realness I then Jenny when they know that where for them and we know <Music/Noise> want to see them succeed in <Music/Noise> and are not going to be the mother just laugh and that I if they're going through hard times that we create a safe place for them to talk about it and not feel bad about it but actually feel good that they're even trying to better <Music/Noise> and that we make them know that they're not alone an answer as well the the I was thinking the same thing that she was I was a bit it seems like people are <Music/Noise> impressed with the fact with just how much things have grown and the fact that we don't just talk about wanting to serve in and talk about doing good business but because we are so passionate about this and because we want to see relationships restored and we want to see this really do well we're putting the work and in growing <Music/Noise> and it's only been a couple months now that we've really been a blast at the community help out in ways it has in and grow its way to say I think this piece that speaks so highly to <Music/Noise> this community ran like this level one which is people falling even finding you on Google <Music/Noise> blogging posts they only <Music/Noise> of who you <Music/Noise> have to live video which is just that's that's real life re <Music/Noise> I think that your community speaks so <Music/Noise> to you guys because of just how much you're letting <Music/Noise> on who <Music/Noise> the types of people you are and I think it's fantastic so we hurried <Music/Noise> couple months now it's live videos is is absolutely huge or you guys always comfortable <Music/Noise> at first for you I see for myself first and then out of the year I got use to live video a little bit with my my past business I was and all and I as a Beach Body Coach and so <Music/Noise> being more comfortable <Music/Noise> through that I was a little bit of a safer topic because I feel like everyone's been talking about <Music/Noise> on <Music/Noise> sharing <Music/Noise> journey on it and so that's where I started and I saw the freedom that came from that since I saw on the power that it had to encourage others and so i addicted to it and hides my insecurities to this I am so that I could help serve <Music/Noise> the best I could <Music/Noise> get in and that's how I got comfortable with it I still get nervous now he has recently topped a bounce and going <Music/Noise> impromptu off the cuff which is <Music/Noise> you but Catholics such as like when we <Music/Noise> Satan and we have talked about it and then <Music/Noise> afterwards and being vulnerable <Music/Noise> moment of you know this is kind <Music/Noise> and that God's heart is really hard because it's in that moment you know it's a little easier if you're like us to train in <Music/Noise> of sharing that means the whole time then <Music/Noise> sun I am getting more comfortable with the cycle is something that me was the difficulty to get started with yet that night so it's really fine like one on one conversation I'm usually fairly comfortable <Music/Noise> training group setting I'm super awkward and surveys the glass for whatever reason super operator lease was starting out I won a stage and completely fine with it there something about bass line like not <Music/Noise> it is super uncomfortable to <Music/Noise> instant feedback and not knowing like people may think I'm crazy <Music/Noise> but you still doing <Music/Noise> ask you why because because I believe <Music/Noise> doing and we've seen the benefits are <Music/Noise> and it doesn't just affect your relationship when your relationship is terrible at Lehi High seems like it's terrible when you don't have those people in your corner <Music/Noise> it's great friends <Music/Noise> the sow sow or know someone you're <Music/Noise> don't have that person is in your corner it's going to love <Music/Noise> take care of you especially when it's on the opposition you go home to someone that makes your life more difficult it changes everything so we've seen the power <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> makes it worth it to face your fears and go out and do the things that you're not comfortable with and talk about things in there we want to talk about this because we've seen power <Music/Noise> with other people love it now ask you again talking about the relationships and working together like how did start when you both work OK we're going to turn this thing into a <Music/Noise> people are going to go online <Music/Noise> scheduling to do is get stuff to take care of how are you How are you able to kind of work together in that way and what devices are tools <Music/Noise> strategies do you <Music/Noise> are implemented to make sure the guys to work well together skits to know what that kind of dynamic is like yeahh when we first start and I Brian wasn't quite sure what his role was in it I <Music/Noise> obvious that content because that's what he basically did as a pastor was As the meantime ten piece and I was used to creating a business previously so I was trying to involve him in every aspect is like sitting there and we would have arguments over whether <Music/Noise> it seem like you don't want her to say and when we finally talked about <Music/Noise> the business is that he didn't feel like yours bring value and it was stuff he wasn't good at so <Music/Noise> that it's okay to not be involved in everything together that there's things that he's good at there's things I'm <Music/Noise> there's things that will do together <Music/Noise> just talking about that in trial and error figuring out what those are he don't <Music/Noise> was huge for us on and then I would say <Music/Noise> that we on the news we <Music/Noise> highly <Music/Noise> our calendar and if you are scheduling and time locking everything I also get dropped and I am that that is probably the biggest thing we had just sat down the other day schedule and rest because that is you keep going <Music/Noise> but if you are scheduling time for rest and you're not <Music/Noise> able to help fill of anybody out of your house and be totally totally I mean I schedule in my morning <Music/Noise> of things to <Music/Noise> stay focused and have breathing room like meditation <Music/Noise> in all this American morning stuff that talked about on the show before I I mean it when when times get tough in yellow <Music/Noise> special you in in and around the work a serene and like I said sometimes a wee and fights with our business partners or whatever like hey what's the best way or <Music/Noise> recommend <Music/Noise> both approach solving those problems in kind if you know putting those fires Aussies can continue on and get stuff done but <Music/Noise> been a good mood again and the sometimes years the outside perspective to help ask questions because we're trying to articulate on this day everything stems back to if you're having <Music/Noise> stems back to some type of corny door and wounding <Music/Noise> is getting you some feedback that either you're not good and I hear <Music/Noise>"
"13","Smart Passive Income Podcast","273_7_Powerful_Things_That_Can_Happen_as_a_Result_of_Starting_a_Podcast.mp3","this is the Smart passive Income podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred and seventy three before it started just wanna say Thank You The The Welcome <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> back and <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> before he goes to bed he <Music/Noise> Who <Music/Noise> Pat Flynn the butts up every path in here and thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> the Smart passive Income podcast and guess what it's just you and me today no guests on this episode haven't actually done a <Music/Noise> really sad about this and I wanted to start like I said earlier we're thinking of not just for listening to this episode but for everybody who has listened to any episodes of any of my podcasts out there whether it's the show or the ASP at podcast or even <Music/Noise> I just wanted to take a quick moment to think you because you <Music/Noise> changed my life the course of this business and the podcast I wanted to talk about today in terms of what has all happened since starting my podcast nine a lot of you already have it I guess and this can potentially be a great reminder for you about <Music/Noise> what we do beyond just being kind of fun but I know there's a lot of you out there who are thinking <Music/Noise> a podcast as well and you might be on offense because you know that it's not an easy thing it's not as easy <Music/Noise> up a bloggin just clicking a couple buttons and then poof you have your blogg podcast does take some time and it is a commitment to do but it is a life changing and I want to take you back to two thousand and eight this is December two thousand actually smart has a thing cannot calm has only been around for a couple months this point and I was determined to start a podcast because like I said earlier Pike has changed my life when I was going through my layoff and had a couple months left till my termination day this is mid two thousand a podcast that I discovered called Internet Business mastery which is still around that opened up my eyes to everything that was possible it was interviews on that particular show that gave me the inspiration to start my own business to help people the architecture space related to an exam <Music/Noise> taken when I was an architect and that just completely changed my life so I always knew that a podcast was an amazing <Music/Noise> actually change a person's life because it had changed mine so I wanted to start one so in December of two thousand eight I published on my passive income dot com a blog post with an audio file is my very first audio file they had ever published online and it told the world even though there weren't that many people my block at that time had just started but still it was a public announcement that had this urge to start a podcast I bought all this equipment and here's what I published in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> as a pat from the Smart passive Income bog thanks for taking the time to listen to this I think that's so awesome that a you know you're helping me out figure out his new podcasting stuff I'm actually just bought a whole bunch of podcasting equipment for myself because I mean I listen to a lot of podcasts I figured hey mind you and so I mean really I <Music/Noise> going to talk about yet so I just wanted to get familiar with all the equipment I <Music/Noise> what it's like to post something on mine and hear what people think about it so I mean he'd tell me should aim to give up on podcasting and is my voice sucks so bad or should I talk a little deeper or I really <Music/Noise> so again just thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me keep going back to the website had tons of information coming up in the near future and let's make two thousand and nine Gray year for all of us let's make it let's make it the most profitable year we've ever had and yeah I'll try my best to help you get there so again good luck with everything happy holidays and this is Pat Flynn from the Smart passive Income signing a peace <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> in <Music/Noise> the ass so I mean the rock knees ache you can tell that my I'm just not confident but I had this urge to start upon guess I always knew it's what I wanted to do well here's the thing that was December of two thousand ate my very first episode didn't come out until July of two thousand and ten so a year and a half later <Music/Noise> many things that were stopping me from moving forward with starting my podcast it took that long to do a number of things one just get over myself because I was just too afraid to put myself out there with podcasting it's not like Laos where you can just easily delete the word that you misspelled and or re spell it the correct way this was your voice right and <Music/Noise> it's not just what you say it's how you say it and the <Music/Noise> and the maidens and all the stuff and <Music/Noise> happy with the content that is producing so I just never published anything out there plus there was a little bit of a technical hurdle to overcome as <Music/Noise> a lot of people online who are helping me at the time for example Jason <Music/Noise> from Internet Business mastery who had a lot of information to help on casters and also Cliff Ravens crash from podcast answer Man dot com is a huge help to me as well now I finally published the first episode just to give you an idea of what that was like Well actually recorded that episode three <Music/Noise> times the first time I recorded it kind of off the cuff I didn't really plan it was essentially an introduction episode shared a little bit about who I <Music/Noise> in what the show's going to be about what kinds of episodes were going to be coming out scene but even as just <Music/Noise> the episode and just not being happy with it at all there was just no confidence in my voice and <Music/Noise> of random pauses <Music/Noise> comes in those kinds of things so I did was I scripted out everything I was going to say I spent about two and half hours writing down every single <Music/Noise> that I want to say so that I could get a perfect thing it right remember re recording its second time around reading it off and re <Music/Noise> animals putting myself to sleep it was almost like I was in a lecture back in college after lunch all tired from eating and eyes was tired and bored and that I just I can handle that was very robotic there's no <Music/Noise> that's what happens when the script out what is the chicken a present or share on things like podcasts to the third time I made a decision I decided that I was just going to put out there I had a couple run throughs already <Music/Noise> wanted the same basically had outlined it now and then I just hit record and I went with it and I tell myself you know what if I make mistakes screw it I'm just going to move forward and get through the muck and then get this first episode and I'm so glad I did that because now two hundred <Music/Noise> two episodes later on the Smart passive Income podcast plus nearly a thousand episodes on ask Pat just so thankful for all the amazing things have happened since letting myself go and just getting started may I think is Johnny <Music/Noise> amazing podcast or find me on fire who said every master starts as a disaster and it was definitely feeling like that way for me when I was just starting I definitely felt like a disaster but a hypothesis episodes that are still available you can listen to them they're great content especially once I started doing <Music/Noise> have to think Mark Mason <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> from late night I am calm like I said after getting started after seeing the results of what has happened since starting my podcasts here's the thing I only wish I'd started sooner I only wish after announced that I want to start a podcast in <Music/Noise> wait that I got over that fear much faster and I just started that sometimes we have to do just have to get started sometimes take the rest of this episode to talk about specific things that happened as a result of starting a podcast because I feel like a podcast is today the number one platform that you can use to gain exposure for your brand to build a relationship with her audience and to really help put yourself on the map now it's something that I know a lot of people have done soley they've built their business as a result of their podcast that they started and a lot of people who have a brand <Music/Noise> and inserted a podcast essentially power up their brand and which ever way it is or which ever way you're going to share with you seven powerful things that can happen as a result of starting a podcast to number one your message will have more reach the message <Music/Noise> reaching this is something that I didn't <Music/Noise> happen I mean you're going to have it because I know there's people who only <Music/Noise> stuff out there they don't want to view <Music/Noise> want to read long posts The prefer to listen in especially with the way podcasting is you can listen on the go your message can be <Music/Noise> into people's lives where no other content can be inserted for example on a walk or driving a car in all this kinds of things I don't know <Music/Noise> to a podcast right now but I would guess that it be a lot more difficult for you to watch a video especially when at this length or read a blog post versus listening you get that passive <Music/Noise> but also <Music/Noise> gets inserted into people's lives lot more so your message is going to have more reach because there are more opportunities for people to discover you but not only that here's the cool thing your message will also have more impact because of the power of voice so you're <Music/Noise> episode right now you're listening to my voice it's much different than reading a blogger's if you were to read the transcript of this for example you lose the emotion behind what it is that <Music/Noise> you lose the day that the kittens <Music/Noise> in <Music/Noise> and you can do a lot of things with your voice to have a much more powerful impact similar to when people are on stage and they start to slow down a little bit to really emphasize a point or they might feel excited and you can feel that too on the other end right so there's a lot of things as a lad dimensions the podcasting and as a result of your <Music/Noise> stronger it's going to be more <Music/Noise> pushed out there more <Music/Noise> more exposure now I know this is happening because I look at the data I've ran surveys in my audience several times and each time it tells me that the podcast is the number <Music/Noise> that people have found out about me and my brand this is <Music/Noise> surprising to me in two <Music/Noise> the first ever <Music/Noise> after I had certain my podcast because you're focusing on search engine optimization I was getting on to other people's sites in getting <Music/Noise> from other people's brands and I was focusing alot on YouTube and the time as well and yet the podcast The podcast is the number one way that people have found out about me and the stages grown <Music/Noise> I first started out as getting a few thousand down as preface A and again I was I was somebody who had added a podcast on top of their existing brand so is fairly easy for me to start to get initial listeners although I know a lot of listeners who found me through podcasts on I tunes and the other directories here's the thing the stage that <Music/Noise> when you think about if you were to compare contests into an actual real life stage even if you have a couple hundred people listen to every episode that's a significant amount of people cars again real people are on the other enlisting you are a human being right and so if you are to create a podcast and you only have two hundred people listening for example imagine a room full of two hundred people that you're standing in front of an eight K they've come there to see <Music/Noise> and this happens every single week rail that really puts that two hundred people into perspective now the point <Music/Noise> episode gets over one hundred thousand downloads so every week when the episode comes out on Wednesday for Smart passive Income I'm stepping into a stadium with a hundred thousand people who are there who are listening to me and calls part about this is yes it's the equivalent of that but it's even more convenient because <Music/Noise> like to actually set up an event at a stadium every single week and how much that would cost and travel expenses and not not only that the environmental impact it's really important to me but <Music/Noise> you could see the benefits of starting a podcast are amazing <Music/Noise> the exposure in your reach and a kind of impact that your message can have with your audience speaking of ions this brings me to powerful point number two for things that happen as a result of starting a podcast and that is going to have a stronger <Music/Noise> with the audience the bond that you create with your audience through your podcast is unlike any other platform in my opinion it is the number one way to scale into the CIA cannot <Music/Noise> a day because it's msn quote but really the podcast is the most powerful platform for scaling <Music/Noise> because even though you're on <Music/Noise> for me as a content producer as a podcast or it's not just one day one an individual it's one to many and you'll find even in a very short time period that the people who are on the other end of your podcast going to start to feel like you're their friend because you are <Music/Noise> you're speaking to them in a language that they understand because they're listening to because you have great things to offer because your message aligns with their values and all those kinds of things when you start to meet your fans and the people who listen <Music/Noise> the rest are talking t like we've been friends for years even before you <Music/Noise> and I learned about this really quickly because I remember when I was really funny I started my podcast like I said in July two thousand ten and I started publishing an episode only <Music/Noise> weeks I have bi weekly episode and was still blogging three times a week so I was deathly still focused more on the block but I remember going my very first conference after his sermon podcast and the feedback I was getting from people who had learned about <Music/Noise> it was all about it I guess they couldn't stop talking about how great the podcast was and how much they love listening to it and a little story that I was telling on a show nobody was telling me anything about my blogging more now i still continue to block but I deftly doubled down on the podcast after that point because that was the turning point for me to realize wow this show is actually getting to people it's connecting in a way that my blogg is not a double down started publishing weekly have been going weekly ever since I had now have added more podcasts different shows on top of this particular show and a It's been an amazing run it's real cool the listeners remember things that I forgot that I said <Music/Noise> lot a little a lot of the little stories and there's one story I was at social media marketing world <Music/Noise> a cruise on <Music/Noise> in Cabo was coming out of bathroom is women from across the way yells at me and see that your big day me and I was just like what <Music/Noise> I do understand <Music/Noise> a duty Lycoming names and then skate shoe came to me her name is Stephanie saw her nametag and she <Music/Noise> that you <Music/Noise> was so funny when he talked about how you are like a big baby when you're born because I had the baby was <Music/Noise> OK which is common names because I had forgotten that on a very early episode one of a little fun facts that I have the beginning of every episode was the thousand <Music/Noise> twelve ounce baby which was true actually set a record at the hospital in Connecticut where I was born and just to give you <Music/Noise> my mom is only for eleven and so I don't know how that all worked out anyway and I hear talk about geometry or physics or anything like that but <Music/Noise> a really funny story because it just <Music/Noise> this person remember this thing that I forgot that I talked about and it was because that <Music/Noise> fact was something that she connected with because she had a large baby of her own when her son was born and so those kinds of things come out in your podcast and those are things that people remember Pi has a great place to tell stories and share fun things like that and those <Music/Noise> that your audience <Music/Noise> and as a result you will become a friend of theirs much quicker so number two again building a strong relationship with the audience that will absolutely happen right number three the three most powerful thing that can happen as a result of starting a podcast not only are you have a strong relationship with your audience but you'd be able to build strong <Music/Noise> and reap or with other influencers out there because here's the thing about a podcast having a podcast is an amazing platform that allows you to ask people to spend time with you on your show if you were to go to an influence in your space and just call them up and say Hey can I chat with me for thirty minutes take your brain more than likely they're going <Music/Noise> because they value their time it's no fancy it's just their attention is being called for quite often so they're more likely going to say now but if you would approach an influence and <Music/Noise> have a podcast and there are people my <Music/Noise> to hear <Music/Noise> well then there's definitely something in it for them is more likely chance that they can say yes and I think back to a lot <Music/Noise> that I deal with people who are high up in the space I realize that a lot of those relationships started because of my podcast for example Tim Ferris I interviewed him in Episode fifty one and if you listen <Music/Noise> of a fanboy in that episode he was promoting The four Hour Chef that I believe in anyway after a few minutes I got comfortable but that was really cool because I was the first time I got to speak to him my hero Tim Ferris who is really influential for me when I first started out in two thousand with his his book The Four Hour Work Week and I guarantee <Music/Noise> that time with them if it wasn't for the show that I had created same thing with Gary Vann attack when he was coming out with jab jab <Music/Noise> it was a great excuse for me to reach out to him and say Hey I have this podcast I love to feature you <Music/Noise> book with the world and my audience and he deftly said <Music/Noise> only for a short period of time because he is crazy and puzzles and is on a lot of shadows but that's like a little bit of a secret for you guys who want to interview people of today are coming out with something that's typically good time for me to ask them to come on your show because they want to promote something there any more likely in that mode <Music/Noise> to more things other people like Selene <Music/Noise> who's going to show a couple weeks who is now one of my best friends in the space because of the podcast that I created and that time we got to spend together on that show because when <Music/Noise> and you're speaking to them for thirty minutes sometimes an hour <Music/Noise> only naturally <Music/Noise> with them of course if that experience is great for them and you give them some results back and so when you're just <Music/Noise> out can be little more difficult but again reaching out to people who are coming out with stuff and actually starting a relationship with them potentially through social media firsts can have <Music/Noise> likely to say yes when coming on a show those are just little random tips that I share on <Music/Noise> people with their podcast but again the relationships that you can build with influencers first of all you <Music/Noise> like leave a chance to build a relationship with them and you don't approach it like am in a target that influence or because I know that it's going out my brand now you want to target that influence or because you <Music/Noise> with your clients as a byproduct of that relationship will be built I hate when people go into relationships I know this because I've been <Music/Noise> end of this before they want to be my fren because <Music/Noise> they just want something for me now but when somebody <Music/Noise> with me who adds value to me in my life who is just friendly <Music/Noise> I want to give back to them right and so you know make sure that when you approach influencers that you're doing it the legit <Music/Noise> but again having a podcast lousy to have almost excuse but a reason actually for people who want to get to know you and build a friendship with you right powerful thing number four it is an amazing stepping stone the podcast is an <Music/Noise> stepping stone for getting on other stages the stages <Music/Noise> digital stages such is blonde and podcast The podcast The podcast it makes a podcast out there more I comfortable if you go on their show because they <Music/Noise> this deal by guessing he probably have that I <Music/Noise> that's all that stuff but it also helps you in physical stages to the podcast was amazing stepping stone for me to get on a real stage it showed people that I had content that was useful that was shared in a way that was impactful and emotional <Music/Noise> is what people want when they invite people on stage have to give a shout out to PT money or Phillip Taylor from PT many dot com which is a financial blog and he is the founder of The Financial <Music/Noise> Conference fin con which is one of my favorite conferences to go to in two thousand eleven in Schaumburg <Music/Noise> Illinois which is right <Music/Noise> Chicago that's where I spoke the first time thanks to PT <Music/Noise> to my show or had heard that I had a podcast and was confident me actually closing that show closing head closing fin con eleven the very first one I mean there's a lot of pressure on me and I was deathly scared to death and I went back to my roots and started scripting everything <Music/Noise> because I was just so scared that's a whole nother story but actually if you go back to Episode two hundred and thirty you hear that story you actually hear me on stage at that and here just my progression through the world of speaking but I would have started speaking I would have been comfortable speaking it wasn't for the fact that I had gotten comfortable with the podcast New podcast you're <Music/Noise> your true self that's why I feel like also it's more powerful and long because of blood you can hide behind your words you can get things out and make them look perfect you can have somebody else did it right I can't have anybody else be my voice Yes <Music/Noise> at People might seem to help make the show great in terms of quality in terms of removing errors in anything like that yes but it's only <Music/Noise> that can be my voice and so become a little <Music/Noise> you when you become more <Music/Noise> works that works in your favor as so if you ever feel likes speaking is something in your future upon Cass is amazing stepping stone for that not only that this brings me to point number five here on a similar amount podcast is <Music/Noise> to practice communication to become a better communicator if you listen back to my earlier episodes <Music/Noise> even if you remember that audio file I played in the beginning I just did not have confidence as a communicator as a speaker because I had no practice but when you do a number of these podcast episodes become a better speaker you become a better presenter of ideas become a better storyteller and when you tell better stories when you communicate better life just seems to give you <Music/Noise> things and it's not just related to your business in your podcasts in your career too it also has played a role in how I communicate in my personal life with my family with my friends and you can almost hear the progression over time adding <Music/Noise> lot of people in the audience who go back to last episode one or when they first discover SP I go back to let this one <Music/Noise> through I get people who <Music/Noise> do that who binge listen to the show which is another cool thing up I guess people do that I those people the town is it that you've progressed <Music/Noise> as a communicator podcasts in the early <Music/Noise> Gray you can tell you struggle a little bit but now you can tell that you are just more natural and <Music/Noise> I am now coughing behind the microphone I couldn't say that before but I'm also more confident like I said on stage I'm confident in group settings <Music/Noise> a story I am confident when I'm speaking to my kids I'm confident when I'm on another person's show which is really cool and so again making byproduct of starting up I cast is you'll become a better communicator which helps you in all areas of life ok we're closing in on the And here here is the sixth most powerful thing and these are really in any particular order but this is just number six and that is there a lot of monetization <Music/Noise> opportunities that come when you start a podcast actually I want to be upfront and <Music/Noise> that and that is there a monetization opportunities that come about when you become a podcast or when you start a podcast it's very difficult to generate income directly from your podcast on day one now there's many mighty nation opportunities in many ways to do it but if you are going to go down the route of sponsorships and advertising doing that <Music/Noise> very difficult even if you already have a brand even if you always have a podcast that has tens of thousands of listeners and start a new <Music/Noise> it's still difficult to get sponsors for the new <Music/Noise> this because when I started asked Patton twenty fourteen even with tens of thousands of live listeners for every ad is as far as I think about the time advertiser still wanted to see <Music/Noise> for this new show before actually saying yes to sponsorship opportunities and so isn't actually until week six day then was able to report data back into potential advertisers who were interested to then you make a deal for the ASP at podcasting that brings me to the first way that you can potentially generate income to your podcast that through sponsorships and advertising and it doesn't happen right away and you need <Music/Noise> to make it happen but you actually don't need as much as you may think that there are third party programs and third party services <Music/Noise> there that will work with you to find sponsors <Music/Noise> to go <Music/Noise> however you typically need a minimum <Music/Noise> of downloads per month I heard at an event once that minimum number is fifty thousand downloads fear Shelley <Music/Noise> per month not per episode per show per month fifty thousand downloads which is quite a bit and that's very scary in that old and then immediately like cuts out a number of podcast is out there in terms of possibility which is why I feel like going down <Music/Noise> route of you actually personally reaching out to companies that <Music/Noise> that you use and asking them if they would like to sponsor shows much better because the way that the income model works out is it's based on CPM model that's cost per thousand <Music/Noise> if you are a thousand downloads only to pay a <Music/Noise> we only paid a thousand times worth excuse me if you've two thousand <Music/Noise> four thousand double that and so even if you have a significantly <Music/Noise> you can still generate income through sponsorship and advertising because those advertisers only pay you per thousand downloads and as long as they understand they <Music/Noise> that aligns with their product or service or tool or software or whatever then there's a possibility that they want to do that now there are other kinds monetization opportunities as well for example affiliate marketing I feel like if you would ask me pat on the podcast was the quickest and easiest way to generate income would actually be through affiliate marketing and that is promoting or recommending a different person or another company's product or tool or software or service in exchange for a commission if people go through a particular link and so I would do is actually target one particular product or <Music/Noise> thing <Music/Noise> wants hopefully it's something that aligns with something that your already doing that to let <Music/Noise> that you use <Music/Noise> way you can speak honestly about an authentically about it you might <Music/Noise> invite the people who work at that company or the CEO <Music/Noise> of the founder on your shell similar to I did when I've invited Nathan Berry from convert kid on the show or when invited Clay Collins Family <Music/Noise> I mean those <Music/Noise> to provide <Music/Noise> to you because those guys are experts in their fields but also to have <Music/Noise> with them so that when I tell you about the products and give you an affiliate link you're more likely to actually follow through because you've earned that trust or you're more likely to know that that's not something for you depending on how you take in those episodes so having the founder <Music/Noise> a person who represent that company come on your show to talk about that product and the story behind it and be very <Music/Noise> with with your audience make me a great way to get affiliate in common to get and gain people's trust before actually following through on a recommendation that you give physical thing about affiliate marketing products that you don't have to create yourself they already exist of course please <Music/Noise> let people know that there's an affiliate relationship that you're letting your audience now at least <Music/Noise> FTC <Music/Noise> you have to tell people upfront that theirs is a potential exchange of dollars between you and that company so simply saying I have an affiliate relationship with this company Orion a commission when I recommend this product is always really important to do but I always like taking on this approach anyway because some <Music/Noise> that they can generate some extra dollars for you at no extra cost to them through going through your link so I am totally okay with that I would recommend it obviously for legal reasons but I'm not a lawyer just want to get out there but that is something that my lawyer recommended to me as a mini recommend that he was well anyway going back to Philly marking is a product that exists you're probably <Music/Noise> talk about them one other thing you could do was just talk about process and through that process <Music/Noise> be recommending different products for example back in two thousand ten and talked about how I built a security guard training website from scratch and through that process into steps required using certain tools <Music/Noise> the affiliate link for those two along the way in because the part of a process it doesn't become a hard sell it just becomes a natural recommendation because it's something you're already using so that's a quick easy way to go about starting to generate an income because you already <Music/Noise> these products out there in the world that you could recommend you don't have to spend the time actually come up with something or build something they can recommend of course you could"
"14","Smart Passive Income Podcast","274_How_to_Avoid_the_Slimy_Sell_with_Chalene_Johnson.mp3","this is the smart has become podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred and seventy four it's time to get to the The Welcome <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> back and <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> inflated <Music/Noise> I turn the what happened here thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> of the spy passing compiled cast so this coming Monday's <Music/Noise> day in the life of SP eye in the life of my business or a new course coming out there to help use one that's been asked for for so long it was beta tested we put together as a and it's now looking to be available to the public for the first time ever July seventeenth of July twenty fourth my brain a course called Power Up podcasting is there to help you streamline the process of getting your podcast set up and running and launched into setting up I guess but had a lawn chair properly how to market it and then later <Music/Noise> had a star <Music/Noise> those kinds of things and there <Music/Noise> all the way through even get access to me through office hours plus is a community there to help you as well this was of course that day it has <Music/Noise> here's the thing going into this and I'll <Music/Noise> it happened im nt going into this presentation which I knew was going clear pitch at the end I was scared really really scared because I am not somebody who was always very comfortable selling often scared me in I just wasn't very good at the start and <Music/Noise> scared me that's why I had an affiliate marketing for so long and you know people have <Music/Noise> me for courses of all different types I just said no nylon the giveaway a giveaway information <Music/Noise> make money off the affiliate commissions and I soon <Music/Noise> that that's very dangerous thing to do because if you rely specifically and only on affiliate marketing and his <Music/Noise> with those companies could go away for whatever <Music/Noise> there goes your income it's always best to have your own stuff to sell if possible so for <Music/Noise> time I was in affiliate marketing and I've now <Music/Noise> this year actually <Music/Noise> courses and it's been amazing it's been awesome it's been so cool to have something I can confidently sell however this particular time I was creating a course specifically for <Music/Noise> who were very much in need of a podcasting course <Music/Noise> help teach them and it was <Music/Noise> he challenged me to come to her stage at marketing Impact Academy in March of twenty seventeen and sell this brand new product on stage and that is something I <Music/Noise> would do and I'll tell you more about how that <Music/Noise> minute but I will <Music/Noise> that we'll some amazing guests coming <Music/Noise> when he actually challenged me and we talk specifically about the void that's slimy feeling that you get when you sell not had a trick your audience know that's not what is about <Music/Noise> through the products that you have to offer them in the thing is if you don't have confidence in <Music/Noise> if he feels slimy about selling <Music/Noise> know is going to help people will then your audience can feel not very confident in what is it are offering and more than likely not purchase so it's not about being a slime ball it's about how to get over that those feelings of becoming a slime ball when you know that <Music/Noise> something great offer going to talk about that in this episode but I wanted to get back into time actually like we always <Music/Noise> it into the into the <Music/Noise> and take you back to twenty thirty I was invited to speak and events in Chicago and it was where <Music/Noise> marketers are uncommon provide a lot of value to a <Music/Noise> and was really cool is that I got to invite ten people in my audience to come for free and so I did that and was great to meet my fans there and speak on stage but here's the thing I <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> first person speaking was it was one of those events where there's only one stage <Music/Noise> everybody who speaks and the first person was amazing oh my gosh such mind blowing content and all the sudden forty five minutes in the presentation it turned into a pitch fest it was one of the things I just in my head I realize that people were invited for free to go to this event because the organizer was going to make money the back end of it from all the sales and the way that allowed these people were pitching it was just it was just getting under my skin a little bit and to see just the hordes of people get up and spend three four five thousand dollars on things that I just I mean I want to give credit to those people who are selling they did very well and again <Music/Noise> much about them or their product but they had great presentations <Music/Noise> had great pitches but it was just as I just could imagine doing that so actually at that event when I spoke I got up I was the only speaker to not sell anything I think it was just going <Music/Noise> much every speaker was pitching that when I finally got up which was on the last day and I said Hey guys I actually kind of rearrange my presentation to sound like a pitch at the end for something that actually gave away for free and so people actually got up and applauded and so that ingrained in my head that selling <Music/Noise> is bad and so I <Music/Noise> to this event from Saline to go to marketing impact Kevin sellers course I was immediately thinking I was going to become one of those people that I really didn't agree with and it really was a big challenge <Music/Noise> of conversations about this and she really helped my mindset <Music/Noise> idea that I had something amazing to offer and she was clawing at me for help and her audience needed my help and that alone was enough to kind of get me over the edge to actually try this thing out and it was a lot of work done with a presentation to still provide <Music/Noise> if people than purchasing the notes similar to the wet our formula but here's the thing I went up on stage I shared <Music/Noise> I shared about how podcasting can change my life and waited for me I shared a lot of content that I learned <Music/Noise> to the podcasting that I knew was going to be helpful for people no matter what content medium they used and then about an <Music/Noise> had had about two <Music/Noise> available to me about an hour and I started talking about this product in the craziest thing happened when I <Music/Noise> this project was going to be available for this audience is a beta test the power of podcasting I actually got applause in that kind of freaked me out I didn't expect that I I share my story and I reveal that I have this product on offer for people who <Music/Noise> the fast track to de sel and I got applause from the audience in I don't know if it's because the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> was finally coming out of my own products after doing three years but that applause like got me going and got me motivated and then the craziest part was that before <Music/Noise> the price point of that product people were already getting up at their seats because that way it works at these events is you handle forms of people fill out these forms with their information and then they go to the back of the room <Music/Noise> do the transaction to get access to the course later on people are getting anything going in the back even before I mention the price it just it just blew me away and the thing about this event was I was going into it very scared that I knew I was going to sell some and was very scare that I was going to go home after selling a few of these things <Music/Noise> to take a shower just feeling like a sleaze ball and just wanted to <Music/Noise> there's like a clip I remember from a splint or a pet detective where he had just done something <Music/Noise> supposed to and then like it was in the shower naked in the corner like crying like that's how I thought I was going to be and I fell the exact opposite because immediately after I spoke I went to the back of the rim to thank all the new customers and they were thinking me at Thank you so much for this opportunity to get this course Paris <Music/Noise> what <Music/Noise> grateful that you're here thank you so much to take a picture just going with a line of about one hundred and sixty people purchased we took pictures I think than they think me and I got home and I just had to kind of let it <Music/Noise> with what has happened and filigree was that was the most amazing feeling of hand while in terms of what I was doing and selling I felt great selling something and then to see the students go through the course <Music/Noise> have their podcast of an eye teens to leave these amazing testimonials man now I want to do it's more right this is completely change my mindset about selling and it's all about what is your offering and how you offer it's not about tricking your audience and having them believe something that isn't true it's about me you <Music/Noise> that this thing that you have to offer is truly worth what it is that you're sharing and offer that you that you're making like Alex like about this because a lot of the struggle of the sights rather live for years <Music/Noise> very personal at this hour and I can't wait to actually come on who has experience <Music/Noise> great products everything from information <Music/Noise> things to her own products or events those kinds of things so let's not wait any further here she is Selene <Music/Noise> from builder tried this shell <Music/Noise> and Selene Johnson dot com Hey buddy what's up I'm so <Music/Noise> looking back Ilene <Music/Noise> on the show <Music/Noise> a key so much for being here at This <Music/Noise> this is going to be I feel like when the most important episodes that people can listen to and to set this up I want to talk about how <Music/Noise> to be I would say couple years ago and to keep this short I just didn't feel good about selling selling to me was slimy I was making money through affiliate marketing so I didn't feel like I was selling <Music/Noise> essentially offering recommendations based on what I was using but when I got to the point which I realize that I had to sell and we'll talk about why name it I just fell to still be key in slimy <Music/Noise> topic that you're very passionate about Ashley <Music/Noise> actually helped quite a bit to help me break through a lot of mental barriers <Music/Noise> Can you speak on like Why do you think that most people feel this way when it comes to selling things has been taken advantage of before we've all bought things that we felt pressured or gilded or i tricked into buying it so our <Music/Noise> is is on <Music/Noise> that we're going to be taken advantage <Music/Noise> nothing feels worse than being taken advantage <Music/Noise> of and it's not that we <Music/Noise> the audience <Music/Noise> helping some <Music/Noise> something we just don't want to trigger that alarm in someone else I think that's why people feel <Music/Noise> unless of course and his <Music/Noise> must of course you're selling something you don't believe in in which case your guilt is appropriately place let's let's talk about that really cook I think a lot of people that come from places of serving <Music/Noise> to do that and there <Music/Noise> percentage of people who know that they're just scam <Music/Noise> snail a salesman and <Music/Noise> to get into that because I think it's obvious that more maybe just feel guilty because they know that they don't believe in what they're what the weather there offering so it's really important to have that belief that what is that you have to offer is worth a And I know a lot of people who have amazing thing Stauffer who still experience this fear and and and because of it the cell <Music/Noise> but without confidence <Music/Noise> they <Music/Noise> don't get crazy numbers straight razor I have use <Music/Noise> in the past yes <Music/Noise> you feel right when <Music/Noise> offers you something and there you can just tell their own they're not comfortable with it they're not completely confident in what they just offered to you and therefore it affects your confidence if that's the way you feel about the saying you know it the fly can think of is if you ever bought an outfit that is it even at all <Music/Noise> but there's something about this story bought in <Music/Noise> fell you looked in a way to convince you and I believe that they might have thought you look amazing <Music/Noise> you you probably feel better about that outfit and maybe <Music/Noise> and had a lot to do with that person's belief and confidence and opinion of how you look in our bed even <Music/Noise> looks in real life or should I bother us so my point is the way we feel <Music/Noise> we offer to our audience a fax their experience with that thing so if they're already walking into this with confidence with the belief that it's going to help them then the likelihood of them going through with the right attitude and <Music/Noise> outcome is much higher so are really doing our our audience the people that we serve a great disservice by having low confidence that if you say your kids off to school each day you're like yes and her eye school is good for you I think if you balance and stuff you know you've got him pumped up about life or they go <Music/Noise> with an attitude that isn't to serve them right but but I think the act of selling in telling <Music/Noise> something that's right for them and selecting a payment I mean that just scares the crap out of people even if you really <Music/Noise> in what you are offering like how do you connect what you're offering with asking for people to pay money for I think that's really where people are struggling it's a mind set shift now when we started at you <Music/Noise> again I didn't like selling but I was doing affiliate marketing which he said very quickly which <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and so i wun ask u how is crazily <Music/Noise> created if you've created something isn't that your belief you're in a crate that because God help the listeners yesterday and <Music/Noise> diving deeper into this in mind the lack of confidence in the quality that potentially put into something and actually <Music/Noise> that before I listen to an episode on your podcast where you're talking about this kind of on line Africa it was say it was the kind you <Music/Noise> and The Boy and I really <Music/Noise> down with you after listening to that episode because I knew it wasn't them like you let them talk your confidence down you know in that process and when when we had were thinking of the waiters were crazy for people you just have to start and you want to price things so that you feel almost like people are taking the price is so dang good day it is crying that you're offering it to people at this price and the <Music/Noise> is to over <Music/Noise> and upright under prices and that's how I feel it when you know in fact it I would say that this is advice I would give to everyone because I made this a state I've given way too much to people because <Music/Noise> about that like for example our program the marking Impact Academy it is we marketed as being in a week or something like be very transparent right now we marketed as the eight week course it's not it's a sixteen week course is if giving you your business life like we cover everything from developing a business to reaching your target <Music/Noise> to Marcie and every <Music/Noise> media platform to run Facebook as you name it but it's so much that people get all the way through it which means I gotta work extra hard <Music/Noise> people that you need eighty houses go back in right but that's because of my own insecurities in pricing something in <Music/Noise> price range and saying I just I know and maybe in securities but also how I overcome selling a product that's priced at over two thousand dollars I need I need to feel like when I'm saying to my audience you you cannot believe what you're getting for this price you will <Music/Noise> it will give you I need to believe that so much that my face turns red with passion their mom is getting mad at people because and giving them and saving <Music/Noise> them so much money so the one where you can overcome that is number one lower your price to a point which you you really feel passionately <Music/Noise> is such an amazing opportunity for people or deliver more you perfect your product so that you feel so confident when you tell people the opportunity is available to them that people who don't take advantage <Music/Noise> feel bad for them from when wanna just give it away for free because you also want people have skin in the game United notice if if if I give somebody one of my This is great because the platform that we use for Life Academy's actually <Music/Noise> what percentage <Music/Noise> each of my students has watched which is awesome because it's like it's like is if your teacher could actually <Music/Noise> you really <Music/Noise> you copied in and if in fact are studying so I live in I can see exactly how much each one of my students is watching and I can tell you that there's been many instances <Music/Noise> given away product or have even offered one of my products as a bonus for free too you know kind of incentive eyes and to make another purchase that he will <Music/Noise> and people get for free don't freaking do it because <Music/Noise> investment and once I feel <Music/Noise> like some is i swear i swear i'll go through every single lesson please just give me a scholarship and we do it and I always track it because I can't wait for that day when somebody shocks me and actually goes all the way through there's been a few sessions but in general when people don't have <Music/Noise> they don't value what is they've gotten from them I remember <Music/Noise> first started <Music/Noise> about fitness and this was after I had my first skin Haqqani <Music/Noise> but I remember after he was <Music/Noise> working out <Music/Noise> just felt very tired like huffing and puffing up the stairs I needed changing and so <Music/Noise> my friends this <Music/Noise> Hey palette I have <Music/Noise> P ninety x video like Al given you and you could just do and <Music/Noise> that if I had taken his offer I wouldn't <Music/Noise> done the thing I would have gone to that through the daily ritual of getting <Music/Noise> Tony <Music/Noise> I <Music/Noise> that I had to go and pay for in order for me to like you said have skin in the game and actually be motivated to do it so I did and my friends I was crazy like why why would you pay for like it's right here like take it yeah yeah but you're right that's kinda <Music/Noise> important <Music/Noise> that begs the question one How do you know what price to charge well there's a couple different ways you can look at that I will say this I don't believe today we'd be crazy anything on a pad of paper and brainstorming because we have access to what is the most valuable thing in the world when it comes in commercials that is you know a lot of your listeners <Music/Noise> me frown from the infomercials <Music/Noise> I done that show that's on TV right now is called Pio and right <Music/Noise> it's the it's in <Music/Noise> spot for a couple months <Music/Noise> the awesome task a tear I love her but one thing that be you know for the last ten years I learned it from them any day it requires to invest into an infomercial as he can guess how to price things or what your market once <Music/Noise> and at these very expensive and focus groups to figure out like okay so <Music/Noise> that are looking for and what we feel about this Niemann and <Music/Noise> about the pricing <Music/Noise> how would it affect the people's buying <Music/Noise> if that were priced at two payments or one flat payment in what should that Christ may be the average new entrepreneur can afford a ten thousand <Music/Noise> focus to present you as <Music/Noise> for a focus group the way every entrepreneur can do who has even say twenty or thirty followers <Music/Noise> is ask your audience so one thing I recommend people do is before you press it down even guessing which are going to price it off for it as a beta test to a very <Music/Noise> group of your target audience not your best friends not the ones are in a you know say what you want to hear but an audience a very <Music/Noise> and take them through it have them go through your program had intended to have them tell you how it can be improved where they got stuck what they would like more of what they wanted <Music/Noise> everything and then in the end they're doing that in exchange for information and should this be price at how what would you need for this how <Music/Noise> this to you how did this help you how much money <Music/Noise> you and those kinds of things make it so much easier and therefore feels so much more confident about your pricing brainer product because you <Music/Noise> it's actually helping people yes that can <Music/Noise> how many programs we've been able to fix before we <Music/Noise> them and that we've been able to land the right price from the beginning because we use a beta test of a task group and you can charge for a beta test in fact I now one of the things they teach to my own sins as you need to charge for the beta test for people even people won't won't do it even though it's free you've got to church even if it's a lower price if they let people know that this is the beta test price you're getting is deeply discounted price in exchange for information <Music/Noise> I just tested fifteen thousand people to a diet program <Music/Noise> and you know that that was explained the prior year to get this deeply discounted price you're going to the beta testing of this will fix it revise and improve it based on your feet up but we <Music/Noise> your green to do this based on this price they'll give us your feedback and the end of it we send a <Music/Noise> and I ask them everything and the the responses back were priceless please <Music/Noise> like one or two the responses <Music/Noise> a mile away oh my gosh yes it's a it's a calm <Music/Noise> Alex McManus and head when they said was Is Too Much Information I would have paid more if there was last and that's hard for like my ratings while yet as they're just they're too <Music/Noise> we we dial it back and okay so we just continue with what <Music/Noise> more more questions <Music/Noise> what pieces were too much and how <Music/Noise> what's the right amount of content because as we think well if I just give people more I can price it more but if you think about it the most valuable thing in the world people is their time so it's not always that you can price a program has a lot of detail at a higher price point it's what kind of or resulting you deliver in the <Music/Noise> of time possible I love that Coble think <Music/Noise> scoop on that <Music/Noise> I've seen what you've talked about <Music/Noise> that test and on Instagram and action snapped as well that's <Music/Noise> it's a great example the FAA's thank you for that now here's the thing I would say that they said to us was that in some <Music/Noise> where I was teaching kind of in depth content that became a little bit science E B they just flat out told me you watch <Music/Noise> because <Music/Noise> a female and some with the lipstick and wonder <Music/Noise> jewelry <Music/Noise> I five is a kind by I haven't paid <Music/Noise> so <Music/Noise> it tested again and turned those important science based lessons into adios and gotten much better response by interesting season you're putting out work up front but it's to attest to understand a kid how to feel about this and what's working what's not had a price at all this things I think that's really important is not anything that happens overnight but it's definitely worth the process now if I were to ask you Celine going back to this idea of selling and being comfortable in it and I are there strategically ways that are better <Music/Noise> to feel good about selling and how I like give us the good ways to do it yes authentically be something that has helped you and you and help other people with people often say to me so would you be doing five <Music/Noise> and I <Music/Noise> I don't know I don't care but I can tell you this I don't need a plan that I because <Music/Noise> helping people avoid whatever I've just been through or I will be helping people understand whatever challenge I just overcome and the end because <Music/Noise> makes me passionate that's what gives me purpose as it makes me feel like I'm supposed that these weird things happen to us I always believed there this was meant to happen because I meant to help I'm here not for myself I'm here to help other people in and when I serve I feel whole <Music/Noise> it's just an amazing feeling so one of the most important is you can do is look at what your challenges then and if you just tell the story of how you got over <Music/Noise> is or through it or around it were saviors of time or in any tender just the same we would sit down with a friend who's about to go through something you've already done through you feel good about the fact you can save them time money a any stress anxiety heartache and that feels really good start by telling your story and then the next so I was so people just get good at telling the story of how you got the other side <Music/Noise> that the other side it's not time to help people yet Riley you gotta get through it and to have some opportunity that people are looking forward to like the possibility has to be there for others <Music/Noise> and to believe that it's possible for them to love that says that's the that's the point in conversation <Music/Noise> a person might say <Music/Noise> I completely <Music/Noise> the motivations <Music/Noise> is this is awesome is coming from a place of giving <Music/Noise> in from your heart based on situations that you've been <Music/Noise> you've got to <Music/Noise> tell me about the product and so when people come to that point in the conversation does matter where this conversation is happening when you begin to start talking about your products specifically your <Music/Noise> for them I think at that point for a lot of people's <Music/Noise> comes or <Music/Noise> the icky feeling we have to like take a bath afterwards comes <Music/Noise> what's the best way to present your product in a way that's going to make it an honest authentic serving <Music/Noise> as opposed to well <Music/Noise> make you pay for this yes this and <Music/Noise> brought this up because I think is the number one mistake people make when they get to that point is in their <Music/Noise> thinking Oh <Music/Noise> I just tell my story and <Music/Noise> and I think that's the <Music/Noise> look at this and we can tell your voice I've watched people do this their voice <Music/Noise> their demeanor <Music/Noise> they stumble for their <Music/Noise> they get to this point in the sale and to me that someone <Music/Noise> they actually <Music/Noise> switched from serving the selling and if you stay in the mode of serving you won't do this but here's <Music/Noise> to avoid u haf to avoid that script the thing that you think other people want to hear is included or that it gives <Music/Noise> going to do for you or that sets it apart you really have to stay to your own scripts so for me in most cases <Music/Noise> is I'm when I'm in a solace <Music/Noise> and I am offerings into my <Music/Noise> on Facebook and I've done this I done <Music/Noise> kind of infomercial style on Facebook thank you Mark Zuckerberg I just can't thank you enough and like them are <Music/Noise> this for free I can't even <Music/Noise> charging me a yellow <Music/Noise> on facebook and I start by doing <Music/Noise> my formula cook them with the problem see gotta grab them with you know that qualifying question that's not necessarily hook I see <Music/Noise> say is this worth should use in the same tune for the next thirty minutes because of the answer to this question is yes stay it's not keeps growing you know have you as I might say have you been exercising <Music/Noise> into the ground <Music/Noise> just you're pounding <Music/Noise> it feels like working <Music/Noise>"

hadn't set out to measure the size of America's lawn in fact quite the opposite I was working to map the amount of paved area <Music/Noise> States mapping out paved areas included using satellite data measured nighttime light emissions light emission that come from physically turning on streetlights the hand and I She and her team also used aerial photography which of course showed more than just paved areas ye be also took measurements of how much law made a day was and how many shrubs data entry area and that's how they came up with forty point five million acres of turf which is just a bit less than two percent of the United States paved areas meanwhile make up just one point three percent the sheer volume of grass that only thinking how our free loans actually functioning as an ecosystem we use water but also fertilizer and pesticides and then use lawn mower some leaf blowers but their plan so they fought the synthesized absorb carbon what's the balance between will be putting in what we put out and so I decided these would be a worthwhile question to ask the specific question being whether lawns are from a carbon perspective net positive or net negative she began by trying to tally how much water people use on their lawns the standard recommendation especially where rainfall doesn't do the job is one inch of water per week and I am up soo some numbers that they could not believe what were these unbelievable numbers the total was about twenty trillion <Music/Noise> per year on lawn watering one little context for that number consider that we use just thirty trillion gallons to irrigate all our crops next Malays he calculated how much carbon the turf grass stores in the soil and then I subtracted from it and amount of coughing that was SAS is here with an eye to them for deviation and the amount of carbon and was a meet that by using a typical on more and when she learned I danced with her for becoming may sink of carbon and this is not surprising at Planned giving plenty of attention focusing his eyes as carbon but hey it comes to the cost of producing the fertilizer or moaning <Music/Noise> the grass and on the industry that comes around it's even with those costs included lawns look pretty good from carbon perspective on the other hand leaves mottled didn't include inputs like the carbon emissions from the trucks that long cruise drive or the original manufacture of all that lawn care equipment nor did it include the energy used to deliver water to households and clean it for human consumption we should not forget that this is the drinking water I do not account for those costs and has just about any economist will tell you water is often woefully under price which can lead to over use especially for growing grass species that wasn't meant to grow where you live Kentucky bluegrass or creeping bent grass involved in the cool <Music/Noise> climates of northern Europe Ted Steinberg again and if not all that easy to grow them here in the continental United States and especially in the reports of North America if you go to California you'll find still longs with cool season turf press every square foot of that turf grass requires twenty eight gallons of water roughly speaking per year every square foot but that's for the coastal environment if you move inland to a more varied part of California that number increases to thirty seven gallons of water or more per square foot of lawn we waste so much water or city and the mayor of the city of Los Angeles we spoke with our city last year when California was deep in drought in Los Angeles lawns and landscaping use a whopping fifty percent of Los Angeles is water and the drought had doubled with the city was paying to import water so Sadie used incentives to change behavior the city paid residents to install rain barrels to capture water for their lawns to pay them to replace their lawns with drought tolerant plants said if you have a lot <Music/Noise> a crate keep it and pay for the water to water it but if you're not let us pay you to switch that out to beautiful flowering green plants that use a lot less water and were able to do that with over fifty million square feet of lawn just the last couple years we've reduced our water in the face of this trout our water usage by nineteen percent without having to find anybody without having to crack down of the water police but by inspiring people through public education and rebates giving them free sis turns changing out their toilets all the sorts of things what works in California won't necessarily work elsewhere and California is more aggressive than most with environmental regulations for instance is currently pushing to lower emissions on lawn care equipment which tends have particularly dirty little engines are also really noisy uh <Music/Noise> if you just hear the sound of leaf Lord it has these really interesting low frequency and high frequency components Erica Walker she just got her PhD in Environmental Health at Harvard so not only is it traveling inside of your walls but has this high pitched hum that's just really annoying in Boston Walker helped compile a citywide noise report which mapped among other things leaf blower annoyance levels lot of places have banned leaf blowers or restricted hours especially the noisy or gas powered models Walker was interested in the relationship between noise and public health in a city like Boston sleep disturbances I think the the direct relationship between sound and negative half of the World Health Organization suggests that daytime noise levels should exceed fifty five decibels Walker wondered how leaf blowers registered even if you were the one blowing the leaves we see them even <Music/Noise> four hundred feet away from the point of operation you're still getting sound levels there in excess of what the world have Organization recommends for daytime sound levels but then we also learned that this leaf blowers have a strong contribution from the lower frequencies it has an ability to travel very long distances and penetrate through the walls so it's really hard to mitigate hand we see in the epidemiological literature that low frequency sound is creating negative health effects above and beyond high frequency sound the eye in the so what we learned so far we have a lot <Music/Noise> and our pursuit of the perfect lawn is noisy and resource and labor intensive ones do however serve as carbon sinks and of course they're beautiful many people think so and useful for playing for picking for relaxing coming up on his radio we love lawn so much even plant them inside our highways as standard Clover leaf takes up about sixty acres of lawn and if you don't

episode about the costs and benefits of loans mostly because of you occasionally we ask for economics radio listeners for story ideas especially for what we cloak wheelie call our stupid stuff series that is things we do or use or submit to that are on some level kind of stupid last time we ask for your stupid stuff ideas quite a few of them concerned lawns Pat Allen Trinity Florida row what is up with the American addiction to lawns John Faulkner of Arlington Virginia complained about noisy smelly <Music/Noise> and then there was Alan Turner from New Castle Delaware my formal training initial career was in landscape architecture in right now I'm looking the highway <Music/Noise> at the rest stop on I ninety five just south of Wilmington Delaware Turner's pet peeve is what's in that highway dress and it looks like this grass gets mowed three times in the summer let's say it's not just in highway medians but also those Clover leaf interchange is a standard Clover leaf takes up about sixteen acres of lawn Turner understands why these are all grass grass is cheap grass is the cheapest ground cover you can install the problem with grasses that is also the most expensive ground cover to maintain and it has to be maintained mode especially for safety for good sight lines so you've got all that knowing and all those traffic delays on the mowers are out there in the medians Turner's ideas to plant highway medians with plants that don't require me it's like grass does the seed might cost slightly more but that's the only difference and then you get a permanent ground cover that needs knowing I can honestly say this the first time <Music/Noise> to talk to anybody about roadside vegetation management Doug he cocks with the Federal Highway Administration which advises states on how to maintain their highway grass nobody asked us about plants they ask us about traffic and potholes I think conservatively we've got about seventeen million acres of roadside vegetation roadside grass think back to the early days of auto travel having a grassy area near the road in case somebody broke down for one to just rest after this ordeal of driving around was a very tempting option so that's what began and as time went on grass sort of became an expectation because everywhere <Music/Noise> there was and when you didn't have it people noticed that was the prevailing attitude we want these roads to look inviting we want them to look like your front yard that begin to change as early as the nineteen sixties state and local governments realize how many resources went toward maintaining all that grass and in the seventies and eighties we began to realize the water was really big issue in states dealing with tight budgets began to plant native grasses things are a little bit more water efficient and dresses that didn't require as much mowing still about Alan Turner's idea to get rid of grass entirely in favor of something that requires no mowing I think he does have a point however I'm also not willing to say that states haven't already considered that there may be reasons why they have to plan what they have budgets are so tight at the State UT level ok not replanting but also just not mowing the grass at all if you were to let something just go wild return to nature that sounds great it sounds easy it sounds cheap and it is it's not necessarily the best choice though that's for the invasive species thrive and that becomes a little habitat for like in the south you've got kudzu that grows all over the place and you've got other kinds of invasive species that pop up and start to proliferate invading local neighborhood lawns or farmer's crop to can get out of control I totally understand he's saying and that's the assumption that is Sarah Wigginton but I think we have to look and see if what we assume is really what's gonna happen and that's basically what we decided to do she's an ecologist working on her PhD at the University of Rhode Island ecological research focuses on finding creative solutions to human caused environmental issues she and her colleagues had a question about invasive species the question that we were trying to answer was If invasive species actually do proliferate in roads areas that are taken out of the regular <Music/Noise> strategies that took advantage of the sort of natural experiment in Rhode Island the Department of Transportation typically Moses roadsides anywhere from three to ten times a year but over the past decade it decided to reduce mowing in some areas and stop entirely in others we classify that as passive restoration because you're just taking it out of the milling circulation and then letting it go letting in succession take course this litte Wigginton and her colleagues compare the number of invasive plant species in the mode areas versus the un mowed which had begun to grow wild they also that the young forests nearby which had never been mowed how did they collect those data it sound not super glamorous we basically lay out really long tape using compass is to make you know straight angles and then a very very time consuming process we document every single species that we see and these subplots what they find we found that invasive species are not proliferating significantly in these areas that are taken out of the traditional knowing scheme they have the same number of invasive as both the young forests and the traditional <Music/Noise> so Al would advise that its state D O T's move as much of their land as is reasonable to a reduced or low <Music/Noise> scheme well I think the easiest thing to do is to elect to have what I call low maintenance lawn Ted Steinberg again he is talking about personal loans now highway medians over treatment is the single biggest problem we have here in the United States with respect to lawn care so right away scale back on the chemical applications you can get away with three applications of fertilizer per season people also probably need to actually learn a little bit about the ecology of their yard to do it right you probably should get a soil test on a big deal leave the clippings on the lawn for god sakes don't put him out on the curb because the clippings break down and they return nutrients to the soil and I would argue consider stopping the irrigation Brown's not so bad though I think you just lost a lot of our lawn loving audience read and think that's that's too bad I'm not saying I disagree with you into saying that I think people think of a <Music/Noise> Brown is death Brown is the enemy Brown is not a law on the next time your lawn if you're worried about this it turns brown go out there get down on your hands and knees and look at the at the grass it's not dead most of them in a horrible drought ok I get it okay but if it's not when it appears to be brown is actually dormant and you'll see a little bit of green where the blade meets the soil the individual plants most of them are still alive Ted I think even you would have to admit that if you got your way and if America suddenly woke up and said you know of and <Music/Noise> lawn is good enough makes lot of sense aesthetically it's fine environmentally it's probably better noise wise it's etc but think of the jobs you're killing I mean this is a pretty substantial part of the labor market especially for low education workers are you Ted Steinberg fests of history in law willing to take the key for killing off all those jobs I think one of the big problems that we have in the United States today maybe even in the world is a lack of meaningful employment but actually it might not be as dire as you're implying here you're still going to need people to mow lawn maybe not as much you don't really need necessarily them for your lawn once a week so this could represent a savings obviously to consumers and it might not be the case that the floors go in for the job market because Ted Steinberg advocates for less in the way of perfection and lawn care <Music/Noise> is also the possibility of repurposing your yard entirely maybe tennis court or an outdoor library or taking a page from our past Jim Bunning Steve and Terry Oh good I Steven and Jim Jim coalesce key is the front yard farmer in New Port Richey Florida A small city just outside Tampa so let me ask you this you came up in lawn care and enjoy that work you know <Music/Noise> thought I did um <Music/Noise> every time I see a line trailer I did she ever seen what it's like tear I don't know if I didn't and you know I I had these so many chemicals especially in and you know as I came to Florida and the lines they got here they got kinds of grass they will not grow without pesticides and herbicides you can get him to do anything <Music/Noise> vegetables and fruit are a different story to grow sweet potatoes and black eyed peas star fruit and avocados lettuce and broccoli and cabbage and cauliflower coalesce key turn the front yard into productive farmland he started with his own yard then expanded to his mom's house down the street next life just buy a house right next door to her three years ago after a mere front yard which is full sun so it's allowed me to have a lot more growing space he sells his produce at local farmer's market I think the best year I had a late two thousand tons of sleep de but theoretically if I get better at this this should be produced in like fifteen thousand pounds I cannot believe how much value can come out of a small piece of land of Alaska gardens all winter in Florida then he drives his nineteen sixty five cherry red pickup truck to mean does the same thing in both places he's known for his salad mix the color Green Zone X and I kind of plant very diverse like it could be <Music/Noise> different leafy greens unable to garden next it as a packet and I wash and spin and put in a bag and sell that <Music/Noise> I'll sell you in Florida probably sell for two thousand twenty five hundred of those bags <Music/Noise> is pretty much the same next thing you know maybe a thousand out there and I don't is a shorter season it's not as populated so I make more of my money in Florida for Cher say how much money to make you know I'm doing <Music/Noise> know I do keep track because I want to show people how much you can make this pudding with a cash business I can hide stuff but I haven't kept track for the last three years are two years really good sell I think first year that kept the attack was like twenty four grand <Music/Noise> twenty seven died down my pace of like thirty five this year I have very little expenses so you know thirty five grants a lot of money I don't know where to spend actually get any help for now it's just you know you know and I've been on kind of a fuss budget and <Music/Noise> I've I've I've learned and you know it's more stressful for me to try to work with other people and make things happen is more my focus is to see how productive a small piece of land can be an unseen that every year and getting better at it are there or were there any legal issues or ordinances you had to deal with to plant a garden in a front yard there you know we're fortunate here because you know it isn't ninety just checked the community so there's not much for <Music/Noise> and there's nothing against a lot to do this I mean potentially there could be some unforeseen issues about the height of vegetation but its always look so good that was never an issue say you sound like a pretty live and let live kind of guy but on the other hand it sounds like you would be pretty happy if you started the front yard garden Revolution yeah I would die when you think I'd be one to lead something like that but I've found that you know people follow things that work I haven't done any promotion over this ten years that there's been a lot of press and then amazed at how people are just longing for this and you know I think it's poised to take and sell you know potentially we can put people back to work on the land I farm in every yard that is hardly the direction our economy's been moving in either the agricultural economy <Music/Noise> care economy but who's to say the rise of the lawn was probably not foreseen would ever turn to personal farming be any more surprising that's it for free time trader this week coming up next time Steve Helton was for years the man behind and beside British Prime Minister David Cameron we have been in touch since the break to vote I think there's not much to say beyond that now Hilton lives in America was taken up a new crusade we want to and the the way that big money donors dominate politics and Wilhelm is nearly unknown here that won't last for long he's got a new show on Fox News called the next revolution and that is going to focus on what I'm calling positive populism how we deal with the issues that have arisen as a result of the populist uprisings we've seen around <Music/Noise> Steve Hilton in all his candid occasionally absurd glory that's right it's next time on Freakonomics Radio <Music/Noise> Radio is produced by WIC

to the story of a man who's quite famous in his native England Steve Helton you've talked about democracy malfunctioning rose from humble immigrant beginnings to join the elite faction these fancy people who became close friends with and ultimately senior advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron I basically was responsible for the implementation of our domestic policy reform program a man who became disillusioned with his position what typically happens in government is the exact opposite of how things should work who became disillusioned with his boss wanted him to make this piece and he always agrees that yes good idea will do to whomever made that speech and who after two years in ten Downing Street left his job looking back on it because I will do my job properly he de camped to California with his family and really have anything planned for my next move but now he's found a new political mission and the way the big money donors dominate politics its mission that includes a new TV talk show I'd love to have the Saudis and the truck to get how amazing would that it's the story <Music/Noise> who sided against his old friend and boss in the biggest vote of all what we have been in touch since the break to vote so I think there's not much to say beyond that a man whose life has regularly intersected with unwanted attention getting very Daily Mail at this point I think I am not sure this is the tone of the conversation that we should be having that avid anyway Steve help the most famous political operative in America that no one in America knows yet at least <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the The The The <Music/Noise> when David Cameron became prime minister of the United Kingdom in two thousand and ten his administration adopted two primary missions Number one in drag Britain out of the worst economic ditch since the Great Depression and number to change what his conservative party and really all of government change what it stood for especially in its interactions with actual people this fiscal mission was largely the purview of George Osborne Cameron's Chancellor of the Exchequer and it was Steve Hill and iconoclastic former ad man who steered mission number two essentially wanted to de centralized central government from within central government some of his wishes were in line with what Americans think of as conservatism fewer regulations than top down government directives reforming welfare and privatizing some public services but on social issues and things like energy in the environment Hilton like David Cameron was oppressive the implicit promise smarter smaller government with cleaner greener in kinder results a very You can have it all package alas much of Britain's having none of it either within Whitehall or beyond the camera administration had its share of victories but it was seen as veering between New Age spin doctoring and old fashioned government tone deafness in the press Steve Helton took a lot of that he was portrayed as the rescue and a true believer in lost causes after just two years in office he took with Downing Street called a one year sabbatical but it became permanent peace in the economist lamented his departure it praised Hilton's efforts to quote open up Britain's Napoleonic state to people power the I found it massively intensely frustrating most of the time and this is where I reflect on the I think that most of that was my fault in the sense that I approached it in exactly the wrong way to understand what Hilton now considers the right way we should start at the beginning of my pairs Hungarian my father right you've also a man many years ago but he was mentioning about him was he was the goalkeeper for the Hungarian national oh yes he was a big sports are hungry and he met my mom actually in the UK but they split up and my stepfather is also Hungarian so my whole family background is from Hungary and the year <Music/Noise> for your step father your father Hilton comes from her seconds at his check yes very good research going on yes we tried but that's your biological father's name your stepfather them to secure in my biological father's name and they made easy to say by picking Hilton and I understand that apocryphal that the name was chosen for the first hotel that they stayed at yes yes that's not true I would say you grew up in London area then you have the first real trip into town to brighten the south coast of England ok so to talk about growing up there and then your schooling understand you did very well at an earlier level won a scholarship to very good school yeah it's an amazing school that you cook rice hospital it's a charity and most of the kids that don't pay any fees that is a charitable foundation and in fact all selected on the basis of some kind of social needs from inner city areas of various kinds actually it's really weird just because it's a boarding school in the middle of the English countryside as far removed as you can imagine from the inner city and its incredible incredibly diverse kids you know from all different backgrounds and races and colors all just makes the other wearing is very We had uniform that dates back to the sixteenth century it's just totally bizarre you went on to Oxford which lets say was probably a little bit less diverse but I tell you what was diverse from me about it was the I met Rich People for the first time and that was really interesting the the at Oxford Hilton enrolled in the famous P P E program philosophy politics and economics the foundation of many political careers indeed future Conservative Party heavyweights David Cameron and Boris Johnson were there a few years ahead of Hilton but he didn't meet them there here's how he got involved in the Conservative Party one summer during university he had such a boring job shuffling around insurance files that he applied for a different job he saw advertised on TV in the UK you don't have political advertising of this is the party political broadcasts with a political body get free air time on the main channels are images of catching one and at the end those very posh guy who's the chairman of the cans of fosters remember him saying at the end of reward to help conserve body right to me Peter Brook I really remember was being about thirty is the right to me Peter Brook and conservatives you know it may be to have some interesting jobs and that's how I go in to that was completely accidental I see so this was the Conservative Central Office it's called that right yeah I think they now call it something as Conservative headquarters though is the party headquarters ok so you basically land this job via the equivalent of what we would think of here's the advertisement on a Mac truck right in that job you meet David Cameron the future prime minister in your future colleague and boss and your future wife Rachel what stones that right Yeah and then there would be many many entanglements among them the fact that you and Rachel eventually would become Godfather to his in his wife's first child who tragically died very young yet David Cameron would become Godfather to one of your children if I have it right that's right and there are other entanglements along the way including before you're married that your future wife had an affair with David Cameron's father in law I'm getting this rate is well yeah getting very Daily Mail at this point I think yeah I'm not sure this is the um the tone of the conversation that we should be having now she comes from what sounds to be an interesting family her parents were involved in politics I understand that Milton Friedman and if a high act would have dinner at her parents' home if that's true but I'm curious to know a little bit more about her background I think that is true yeah her grandfather who was going to be shot for getting this wrong but I think this is I think the stories that he was a refuse pile in the SEC more worn came back and I was a business but I think he was the person that brought sort of industrialized chicken farming to the UK something like that idea of having seen in America interesting and you know keep chickens in your back yes you all know you've de industrialized the chicken process I got the and he think this is what he read high IQs famous book The Road to surf them I was inspired by it and that book argues that the basically that the measures that were undertaken to win the war in the centralization of the economy and that in the growth of government would inexorably lead to the enslavement of society and that the growth of big government had to be checked so did Rachel grow as <Music/Noise> or is he what he went to see high at that time I think was teaching at the NSE them School of Economics and said I read your book I think is great I will help put these ideas into practise I'm going to run for parliament as a Conservative MP and Hyatt said to him if you really want to change things don't do that because the first thing you have to use when the battle of ideas so don't go into Parliament them better use of your time and money if it would be to set up a think tank so that's exactly what he did and so Rachel's grandfather set up the Institute of Economic Affairs which became the kind of powerhouse think tank for free market thinking in the UK energy around the world and really incubators love the idea is that the mobile Thatcher adopted and implemented as promised the the the Even though Hilton is talking here about his wife's grandfather he could be talking about himself he has come to believe that industrialization and institutional of them especially as they intersect with government are essentially a drag on humankind he recently wrote a book about this is called more human we have designed and built a world that is in human rights in governments the world over political leaders preside frustrated and impotent over vast bureaucratic system that routinely disappoint and leave citizens enraged that they can't control what affects their lives can complain that our food our education our health care are quote provided by anonymous distant industrialized machines now how did he come to hold these views straight out of college I worked at the Conservative Party that was just a couple of years and then I left and worked at an ad agency Saatchi Saatchi where most other things business basically an also did a lot of elections and public advocacy campaigns around the world including in anti racism campaign in the UK they then gave me the idea for my next move which was to start a company called good business which was a corporate responsibility consulting firm that lasted another seven or eight years and then we worked for some of the biggest companies in the world trying to advise them how to improve the social environmental impact and that intersection between business and social and community issues environmental issues I think that really informed a lot of what I then try to bring to the project of modernizing the British Conservative Party Hilton's re entry into conservative politics came in two thousand Fife he wanted to run for parliament but lost out in the selection process he was however offered a job by his old friend David Cameron now his late thirties Cameron was a member of parliament with designs on being elected leader of the Conservative Party and we're around this really great in surging campaign where his body was based on his character and his optimism and sense that you could put together a positive account of water more conserved is more to represent in the modern age really understanding the problems of today but a plank and service solutions Cameron won that contest and of course the larger one five years later to serve as prime minister Hilton was central to these victories and became perhaps even more central once Cameron moved into Downing Street the the you personally Steve Helton became known at least in the media as a figure that's really not not not so uncommon in American politics as well but maybe more pronounced you were considered brilliant occasionally devious plenty of enemies you spoke your mind you you did not stand on protocol you like to not wear shoes you like to not dress up the way that most government officials and aides typically dress up and behave and you seem to have a kind of I mean this is some positive kind of ruthlessness for accomplishing an agenda talk about what those first couple years being in the administration were like what you felt was going <Music/Noise> what you felt wasn't going well what I think that what went well was the leadership that David Cameron particularly provided in terms of stabilizing the economy and basically I think that at the time he took office the other country ready die predicament and people are incredibly anxious about what would happen pretty quickly he established the sense of orderly calm of the situation and I think achieved in the way his main goal which is which is to give the country kind of responsible stewardship I think that's that's what he mainly saw the job as being anti absolutely delivered on that did you enjoy those first couple years I should choose choose to put enjoys incredibly hard work incredibly frustrating is an amazing provision that says sounds like a bit of a cliche but it really is just to have the opportunity to work on problems that the real and try make a difference in people's lives I think one of the best actually was something that we introduced with national citizen service in the idea that was a kind of non military national service for teenage is to try and create a sense of community cohesion and social mixing and bring people together from different backgrounds and also to be the possible development that's a specific thing where I can say you know what that really was something I'd conceive with David Cameron right to the beginning and soared to its implementation SOC very rewarding and the National Citizen Service was the quintessential Hilton idea that is government using its leverage to throw some organizational mojo back to its citizenry was part of a grand vision he came to call Big Society the argument went like this previous Conservative Party leaders had said you know the enemy is big government and we need to cut back government to roll back the front is of the state cut back the size of government cut spending and everything will be great and that certainly had its appeal particularly in the UK in the the end of the nineteen seventies when people feel that the state really had got way too big an out of control but as you went through the eighties people so that actually if you just cut back government and left it that people were often left behind and social problems were addressed and so we tried to make more nuanced argument than just saying smaller government we say yes we want the answer to all problems is not Big Government Big Society David Cameron fully embraced the idea the idea of the Big Society is trying to help individuals and communities and policy is to come together and find solutions to the problems that we have just a big idea is that you're looking for Big Society announces Rob and Big State oats is among the cornerstones of big society more power to local communities and institutions including government and police more volunteerism and support for all kinds of co ops and social enterprises also a push to make government radically transparent by publishing more data on paper and in Steve Helms mind the phrase Big Society was a winner but to the opposition and the press it was a touch too Orwellian and then it became the subject of political argument back and forth perception wasn't the only issue there was also the need to execute what typically happens in government is the exact opposite of how things should work instead of starting with real people and then needs and understanding <Music/Noise> work and putting together programs that are in touch with that and what with that you go in you're in a hurry on to make change happen you just sitting at the center and office with the leaves of pounds was a steamroller way through and actually that usually ends in massive waste of money and disappointing outcomes and that is the story of every government it seems to me regardless of their political persuasions on is a lot to learn Hilton came to be seen as a bit of a hypocrite talking up power to the people from within the ultimate core of power it didn't help that he usually kept himself way out of public view so that if it was a time when you know it seems are shadowy we IT advisor unit rescued and that's all that kind of stuff was written and I think that during that time there was a lot of misunderstanding and particularly I tell you I think you know there's a trail of me on one of these TV shows to come and that the thick of it yeah what it was the thick of it I spent ten years detox find this party by renovating an old <Music/Noise> house to eat in take out the sexes being here callous window that replace the old homophobic reef style but after awhile you realize that this renovation is doomed because the foundations are built on what I can only describe as a Sony but of the yet exactly what he was funny and you know I get in my loft but the thing that was with his reserve wrong about that was the characters just was entirely focused on personal presentation and how things are going and actually I think for a long time that was how I was sort of scene rather than at you I really care about substance and policy exactly the among the policies that he cared about most whether Britain would stay part of the European Union coming up on economics radio is harsh difference with Cameron on that issue eyesore breaks is an opportunity for the UK to be a really dynamic open pro enterprise country engaged with the whole world also we learn the unlikely sight of Hilton's political re awakening of the school D stands for the design we find out what he's up to these days and how his new TV

political tech startup based in California and I'm also the host of a new show on Fox News on Sunday evenings cool the next revolution and that is a show that is going to focus on what I'm calling positive populism how we deal with the issues that have arisen as a result of the populist uprisings we've seen around <Music/Noise> particularly in the UK with breaks in here in America with Trump's election in a positive way talking to help you begin to sense that these populist views on government aren't so different from his own views although he has really intensified while serving in Downing Street the U left Number ten after a couple years moved to California with your family according to The Washington Post At least you left Downing Street quo after becoming disillusioned with Cameron's progress and the lack of boldness no idea if that's sure not want you tell us I mean the immediate reason was was a family one in the sense that which my wife she's head of government relations and pee off of Google and she was committing a lot basically to put under the California which is pretty tough and what our second son was born I just got ready so we decided to move that was the immediate reason but frankly I I think that description then that you read out is is correct but if I look back on it I think that he really is it was my fault in the sense that I hadn't really figured out how to deliver for David Cameron the kind of revolution that we had promised and to actually do that in a way that worked with the institutions of the bureaucracy that we inherited rather than just sort of relentlessly attacked them and I think that that's my full so I deeply felt decision to the time and his wife Rachel wet stone had been a very high profile power couple in England in California not so much I mean that's not love I love California thing is just the best place in the world what Stone was Head of Communications and Public Policy Google for several years and left for a similar position at labor but she left that job quite abruptly and it was revealed soon after that British watchdog agency was investigating whether old friend David Cameron had improperly lobbied on Cooper's behalf Hilton meanwhile had met some people at Stanford and from that rose the opportunity to teach them various parts of the university and most importantly at the school that the school the D stands for design is the Institute of Design at Stanford and that really was for me a transformational experience transformational but also bittersweet if I'd had the benefit of the experience before I had the privilege of working government I think I would have been a hundred times more effective because if we adopted Indian government was taught as a human centered design or design thinking it's really simple you start any project with an intense focus on the user who are you designing for who is supposed to benefit from this and that is really on the sound their lives then you generate some ideas and if we do anything you test them out you turn them into a very cheap prototype that enables you to get feedback before you go to the expense of building anything or if the palace and government if we actually start spending real money on implementing a program yet she tested out with people get reactions and the process of rapid low cost prototyping and testing is totally absent from the way government operates and if that was present I really believe you would save so much wasted money and have so much more effective government programs I guess where the parallel between let's say designing consumer products and designing policy seems to break down as the following When your firm trying to come up with the right product for your consumers your eventual consumers you can do that kind of you know in your garage without a lot of scrutiny when you're doing it in government you have intense and constant scrutiny both from the opposition party or parties and the media which makes it harder to do things like rapid prototyping and experimenting because you're always <Music/Noise> about you know the Redux Div form of your idea getting released to the media and being ridiculed or being shot down by someone else to talk to me from in a bow whether you really think that model can work as well in society and politics as it can for something like designing whether it's user experiences for companies like uber or Google to firm your wife has worked for or or something else government can do this can really start to work out how better to address some of these problems in very very small and low key way the tree with a couple of hundred people you need to spend a fortune on some big pilot program is announced in the media and then scrutinized but as another point I want to make which is you're so right about this the way that the media climate which is inevitable by the way I'm not complaining about it is just a fact of life means that politicians and government officials really risk of us when it comes to trying to bring for innovations or even let experiments happened that you can learn from and one of the things that really needs to happen is to try and change the culture arm of the week we tried for years in the run up to the twenty ten general election we try to persuade David Cameron to make a speech where he would explicitly say he is our agenda for reform it includes trying lots of new things out innovations that will bring for new ways of dealing with problems inevitably when we do that things will go wrong there will be failures as well as successes week on God and we wanted to make the speech to set up the fact and to give us some space for that kind of experimentation and he always agrees yes good idea will do it"

and click be on the show TMS idk dot com also tell you everything you need to know about the podcast upcoming live dates to hear from you <Music/Noise> the I remember standing in my kitchen cooking dinner for my son I just we just burst out laughing you know it was the family this joyful thought of is it crazy that nature has come up with this incredible little machine the history of science is full of accidental discoveries penicillin perhaps most famously but also gunpowder and nuclear fission make sense does not because you don't know what you don't know you don't always know what you're looking for her at sometimes you've just got a curious mind so the research project that led to this technology was really a you know it was a curiosity driven project Jennifer Dowd is a professor of chemistry and biology at the University of California Berkeley and I've had a longtime interest in understanding the fundamental biology in particular aspects of a genetic control and the way that evolution has come up with creative ways to regulate the expression of information in cells when you first heard literally heard the phrase crisp air just describe that moment what your understanding of it was and what you kind of initially envisioned it facilitating well when I first heard the acronym crisper this was from a conversation with Jill Banfield IAEA had no idea that was this was in two thousand and six Banfield also a Berkeley scientists have been studying bacteria that grow in toxic environments so she was looking at bugs that grow in old mine shafts and you know these pools of water that filled up in old mines that are often very acidic or they have various kinds of metallic contaminants to figure out what bugs are growing there and how are they surviving the key to their survival was cold crisp or clustered regularly enter space to shore Palin drew MC repeats say that five times fast Banfield thaw the bacteria have developed a sort of pattern based immune system to protect themselves but exactly how it worked was a puzzle to help solve it she recruited Dowd and we ended up spending several afternoons where Jill was showing me her DNA sequencing data from bacteria and you know explaining what these sequences work began as a casual conversation about an obscure subject grew to consume data for years finally she had a breakthrough we just burst out laughing today I'm free comics radio the mind blowing discovery already changing medicine and more a remarkable gene editing tool called crisper that's right I said gene editing the implications of that boundless change wasn't telling the story I feel its chill in my body and if you think the genetic revolution is still years away think again the technology for that is here now the <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the the the the congratulations on your future Nobel Prize and <Music/Noise> Jennifer Dowd hasn't won the Nobel prize yet but it's hard to imagine she won't go back to when she started working with Jill Banfield learned that Christopher's were DNA sequences stored in the cells bacteria you can think about it like a genetic vaccination card it's a way that sells store information in the form of DNA from viruses to use in the future to protect cells if that virus did show up again in the cell had a work in what might it mean if scientists can figure it out in two thousand eleven having already studied crisper for a few years it ended microbiology conference in Puerto Rico there she met a man U L Sharp Antti a then a researcher at Mel University in Sweden sharp Auntie A was researching a mystery protein that she felt was the key to crisper she and Dowd began a long running collaboration we were working together to understand the molecular basis other words what are the molecules that allow bacteria to find and destroy viral DNA that was the question that we set out to address and in the course of that research and in the course of that research we figured out that a particular protein has a name Cass nine is programmable by the cell protein that can be programmed to fight viruses you can start to see where this is going the amazing thing that this CAS nine protein does is it works like a pair of scissors it literally grabs on to the DNA and cuts it at that place at that precise place the thought of nature could program this CAS nine protein to precisely at DNA why can they it turns out that when this is transplanted into animal or plant cells are human cells it's possible to introduce changes to the DNA very precisely and that's how the technology fundamentally works then came the night at home cooking dinner for son when she burst out in joyful laughter at the sheer wonder and the mass of possibilities is it crazy that nature has come up with this incredible little machine so so there was that third moment and then I think that sort of morphed into a growing recognition that you know this technology was going to be very impactful in many different areas of science dao de together with sharp on today in several other colleagues wrote up their research and on June eighth two thousand and twelve formally submitted to the journal Science was published twenty days later suddenly the world knew that the crisper Cass nine system could be harnessed as a new gene editing tool a new kind of genetic engineering is revolutionizing scientific research scientists think Chris Burke could launch a new era in Biology and Medicine Chris Burr could help rid us of diseases like cystic fibrosis muscular Dystrophy and even HIV and cancer Jennifer Dowd has spent her career largely cloistered in laboratories she didn't have a high profile background I grew up in a small town <Music/Noise> suddenly she was a scientific super hero weeks for those questions with Jennifer Dowd have a doubt that Jennifer Dowd Jennifer doubt the ancient bacteria immune system as a powerful gene editing technology breakthrough Prize is awarded to a manual shop on T A and Jennifer doubt no doubt has spent the past few years racing forward while also trying to slow things down she wrestles with all this in a book she co wrote with another crisper researcher Samuel Sternberg it's called a crack in creation <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the title refers to what well and it scores the crisper gene editing technology is is now giving human beings the opportunity to change the course of evolution and you know human beings have been affecting evolution in for a long time rate I think now there's a technology that allows a very specific changes to be made to DNA that gives us a new level of control and so you know it sort of opening a crack and I sort of see it is like analogous to opening a door to the future that is really you know a change in the way that we think about our world as opposed to like a crack in the dimension that we will fall through and all disappear not that kind of crack I wheeled the former not the latter yeah okay so as you are in the book we uncovered the workings of an incredible molecular machine that could slice apart viral DNA with exquisite precision so when you call an incredible molecular machine your breakthrough of you and your colleagues essentially an external human guided replica of what already exists or are you kind of taking over the controls of what inherently exists this is important we are really taking over the controls of what already exists and were doing it by using this bacterial system the cast line protein to find and make a cut in DNA in but say human cells at a particular place where the cells natural repair machinery can then take over and do the actual editing what's amazing to me is the natural repair machinery obviously exists and maybe it works really well a lot of the time just in the most drastic circumstances like a cancer or a debilitating disease that doesn't mean the healing mechanism from reading what you've written it sounds as though it's quite stick ass think it's random unpredictable some things that catches something that doesn't sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't so can you talk about the big picture of this repair mechanism and how well or poorly it does sure so DNA repair happens all the time in cells and as you eluded to it has to work right most of the time <Music/Noise> would probably not be here or we will have a lot more cancer than we have and so we know that at that sells experience double stranded breaks to their DNA <Music/Noise> were routinely and that they have ways of fixing those breaks and so I would say that what this crisp or technology does is it really taps into that natural repair pathway The <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> tenth the announcement of the crisper Cass nine technology the scientists around the world exploring possibilities in many different arenas let's start with plants <Music/Noise> I think it's important for people to appreciate that you know for Saul that humans have been modifying plants for a long time no genetically and young for this literally thousands of years exactly thank goodness right and you realize Wow I'm glad there's that I'm glad there's light reading but you know the way that's been done traditionally is to use chemicals or even <Music/Noise> to introduce the genetic changes into seeds and then plant breeders will select first for plants that have traits that they wanted of course can imagine when you do something like that you drag along a lot of traits that you probably don't want and you know change is the DNA that you you don't even control for right so you don't <Music/Noise> what they might be doing and so I think the opportunity here with gene editing in plants is to be able to make changes precisely so not to drag along traits that you don't want but to be able to make changes that will be beneficial to plants but to do that very precisely and then we have the opportunity to do things like you know give plants the ability to grow with much less water or to defend themselves against various kinds of infections and no pests that are moving and do climate change I think from the perspective of the world food supply that's going to be extremely important going forward and will potentially allow us to have access to plants that are going to be much better adapted for particular environments and to grow we hope without chemical interventions of different types know given how nervous some portion of the population is about the phrase genetically modified organisms even though as you point out almost every organism on earth has been genetically modified for you know hundreds if not thousands of years this feels like a next level step that will raise all kinds of questions even the plant world forget about humans or animals yet no governance and autonomy and so on what are your thoughts on that in the in the plan to slash agricultural world I think that you know it's really going to come down to people having access to information about where is our food coming from so that people in different countries can evaluate these plants in the technologies used to create them and make their own decisions about what they want to do and having a precision tool that allows us to generating plants that are better let's say adapted to particular environments are you know maybe have even better nutritional value and I I really believe that going forward that we can afford to reject this we really have to understand it and you know regulated appropriately but we do have to I think we have to have this to our tool box <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> crisper gene editing is also being put to use on animals scientists in China are engaged in controversial research genetically modifying beagles to be more muscular these mosquitoes have been genetically modified to preach with and eliminate that these pieces in an urgent attempt to <Music/Noise> of dengue a few researchers believe that they can recreate the only man that by combining its DNA with that of a modern elephant is at least one <Music/Noise> company now that are using the gene editing technology and animals like in pigs to create pigs that would be better organ donors for humans I think the micro pig to Chinese genomics Institute BG I began reading micro pigs to study diseases but now they're going to sell them as pets for sixteen hundred dollars and given to the micro pig race Miley Cyrus has one yes that's the way the idea of you know the sort of a fanciful use in a way of G editing innovate making the animals that we think are cute <Music/Noise>

about ourselves our history in the future just begin by telling what you mean by the social genomics revolution what's revolutionary about it and describe kind of the Ark of the revolution where we are in that ok well the social justice revolution is really just getting started I would say when Bill Clinton stood up in the year two thousand and now set the book of life had been decoded we're here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome without a doubt this is the most important most wondrous map ever produced by humankind everyone thought everything was going to change suddenly we're going to have personalized medicine we're going to I don't know what it will revolutionize the diagnosis prevention and treatment of most if not all human diseases but actually not much happened for the first decade or so the great scientific hope was to find single easily identifiable genes that controlled cancer or depression or intelligence or even just high so that turned out to be an exception rather than a rule that's Jason Fletcher he's an economist at the University of Wisconsin Madison and he's calm he's co author on the genome factor most of what we care about most of life's important outcomes are not one gene one disease are more like hundreds or thousands of genes all with really tiny effects if you can even find them having a map of the genome is one thing in the Bill Clinton era there was a lack of good data that has changed and now we have this what I call the revolution is this surface of cheap data cheap generic data just two decades ago a Casa billion dollars to sequence a single genome and now <Music/Noise> I could spit make up and send it to one of the popular sequencing outfits in four hundred dollars or four hundred and fifty dollars we can get millions of answers the question What is our DNA look like anyone who sends their saliva into twenty three in me just a small saliva sample to learn about your ancestry through York twenty three pairs of chromosomes and make you who you are to get their ancestry or their supposed health risks as now basically agreed to be the part of their database that will be studying ness has well over a million samples of mostly U S citizens and all that data is being pulled together and both genetic analysis and social science analysis to try to understand the vast array of outcomes were all interested and that's anything from Alzheimer's and dementia on the hillside to measures of educational attainment and socioeconomic position on the social science side so we finally have big data sets with lots of genetic markers across the entire set of chromosomes and where now actually making robust discoveries that are withstanding replication and seem pretty solid I think that's the start of the revolution but warning it's still early days that's right so humans are very complicated and the amount of data were talking about is in the millions or tens of millions of locations energy know what does this mean for technology like crisp or gene editing I think that's going to be very exciting firsts a limited number of single gene diseases diseases like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease and Huntington's disease but most things we care about in today's world heart disease Alzheimer's IQ height body mass index diabetes risk all of those things are highly apologetic that means that there are the sum total of many little effects all across the chromosomes and that probably means we're not going to be doing <Music/Noise> a thousand different locations in the genome least not anytime soon but with all the genomic data that are being accumulated scientists have been devising a system to make sense of it all we have a tool that emerge called apologetics court to take all the small effect sizes are finding across many many many genes add them all up in the new created a summary scale of your predicted likelihood of doing X where X can be smoking or getting dementia we're going to college but those scores aren't predicting very well right now so before anything drastic happened socially I would think that those scores we need to get a lot better when state is really starts playing a lot of the variation in society than I would start worrying worrying because why the use by external authorities and companies of this information that's definitely scary I think the other dimension is going to being in the marriage market where people just take it upon themselves to want to know genetic information about their potential mates I mean if you knew that your potential mate was a high likelihood of developing early dementia you might think twice before getting married I mean you know the new types are for hookups but Gina type is forever so the technology for that is here now could be use in infertility clinics could be used on dating apps where people could put their genetic profiling from twenty three need to OK Cupid in the selection of course is something we all do everyday is how we choose our friends allies and enemies our political leaders some traits are observable others less so some are hair table others not if the selection potential afforded by these new technologies is frightening to you keep in mind the thing that's new about this is the technology remember the eugenics movement that was justified by a preference for preference for people of certain European ancestry are not all European ancestry but certain just the favored groups to have more children and to be given resources to the exclusion of all their people and of course that led pretty directly to Nazi ism and the extermination of millions of people and it also was used as the pseudo science behind at least decades of racial injustice in the United States and many other countries <Music/Noise> is the nightmare that is given Jennifer Dowd an actual nightmares <Music/Noise> that really was one of the defining moments for me in terms of thinking about getting involved in the ethical conversation so I had a dream in which I was working away I think I was in my office actually and a colleague of mine came in and said I'd like to introduce you to someone and I would like you to explain the crisper technology to him and he led me into a room and there was a late in the room and there was someone sitting in sort of silhouette in a chair with his back to me and he turned around and I realized with this horror and I can feel it right now isn't telling the story I feel its chill in my body you know that that I realize that it was Adolf Hitler and he was looking at me with very very intent look on his face and an eager kind of look you know he wanted to know about this technology and I felt this incredible sense of fear both a personal fear but also profound kind of existential fears that you know it someone like that were to get a hold of a powerful technologies like this how would they deploy it and of course it you know when I woke up from that dream and I you know thinking about it subsequently and it was really scary to think about and I thought you know this we haf to proceed responsibly here we cannot just early for me myself I can just carry on with my next experiment in my lab I really have to get involved in in a broader discussion about this it's just too important a subject I hear I don't mean to at all diminish year your argument but I hear a lot of scientists make a similar argument which is you know look we're we're doing our best on our end and we <Music/Noise> to have this conversation kind of in public especially with people who had the leverage mostly politicians that say Choo makes smart choices my question is does a good mechanism or forum for that kind of conversation really exist well I think we're kind of building as were going at some level I've been involved in organizing a number of meetings there right now they're fairly small in focus but the idea is to really answer we hope that question that you just posed is how do you do that how do you bring people from these different walks of life together so they can have a meaningful discussion I don't have the answer yet but I do think that has to involve formats that are accessible to people it can't just be a bunch of academics that you know maybe talking in the silo to each other right exactly cannot be that it has to be using various ways I think the media are going to be very important I think people that write science fiction are going to be important I think that movie makers are going to be important musicians and various kinds of visual artists are going to be important I think all of those people are very skillful at communication communicating ideas and they can do it in in some ways much more effectively than you know a lot of technical jargon would ever achieve so probably the most enticing and certainly the most controversial aspect of crisper is the power to reshape human beings whether an individual with an illness or a generation of a family or maybe an entire population so obviously it's a gigantic area and something that probably nobody doesn't bring a lot of strong prior to the table with already can you just talk about this issue and <Music/Noise> thinking about the issue in kind where you've landed I've seen an evolution of my own thinking quite frankly you know I think that I sort of have gone from feeling very uncomfortable with the you know sort of the idea of making changes to human embryos is especially for anything that would be considered you know not medically essential to to thinking that you know there may come a time I don't think we're there now <Music/Noise> it's I don't think it's right around the corner but I think there may come a time when that sort of application is embraced and is going to be deployed and and I think that for me the important thing is not to reject its actually to understand it and and really think through the implications not let me ask just to take a step back and talk about actual therapeutic I guess treatment and the difference between germ mine and semantic editing ah yes the sets are important to understand the difference so you know most of the applications that we've been talking about especially in in medicine right now involve what we call some attic cellar editing and that means making changes to the DNA in cells of a particular tissue in a person that's already fully developed but those changes do not become hair table they can't be passed on to the next generation but the contrast that is changes to the germ line and that means making changes the DNA of embryos or eggs or sperm changes that are inherited by future generations and become effectively permanent in the human genome and so I think there's a profound difference between those two uses because if you're doing something that affects one person has to regulate of course not to make sure that it's safe and effective but it affects just that one person whereas if you make a change that affects somebody is all of their children all of their children's children et-cetera That is really profound and it really does affect ultimately you know human evolution and presumably let's say I cared enough about some strain of hair and ability enough to do it"

to the Oracle of Omaha Warren buffet the No not that famous Midwestern billionaire this one my name is Charles Koch and I'm chairman and CEO <Music/Noise> of Koch Industries he's also one half of the controversial entity known as the Koch brothers Koch brothers are trying to buy America day all the culprit is helping to lead <Music/Noise> in my view against working families in this country he must've seen this coming right I knew it would be nasty and unpleasant I did know it would be this dishonest Charles Koch isn't much of a media fixture but over the course of several weeks he sat down with free comics Radio four series of conversations he discussed what his critics say about him most the fact that I'm familiar with the wrong how he first came to see modern politics as corrupt my first real brush was this Was I thinkin' nineteen seventy two when Nixon was campaigning and why so worried about America's future worrying increasingly have the under both Republicans and Democrats toward a system of control dependency in cronyism the petting individuals and groups against each other and destroying opportunity in progress he talked about the political issues of the day I will let anybody and who will make the country better and no <Music/Noise> make the works and that would be the same thing of people who are illegally the The I'm not in favor of people doing drugs on the other hand extreme criminalization has it were the the obviously if the temperature continues to go up at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful the we ask the questions we know your thinking now the public line I knew however is that well everything that Charles Koch are the Koch brothers advocate societal easy or politically is just an effort to protect or extend their business interests so make your best case how and why that's not sell we oppose the ext Anders the tax bill which are tax exemptions and we made a lot of money from those we oppose this border adjustment fee that would make us over a billion dollars a year ago on we hear praise from some unlikely quarters the call rather uh <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the credit the end we get to what kind of person Charles Koch really is I have to say I say this with the utmost respect your total nerd aren't you know what a fun loving guy I was a rugby player you give me the posts the The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host Stephen of Mary the the the <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> Charles Koch lives in Wichita Kansas which is where he grew up got away for many years two grown kids a daughter who's a writer and book publisher and the sun which runs the Koch Industries fertilizer business Charles Koch was born in nineteen thirty five the second of four boys brother David lives in New York he's also involved in Koch Industries though less so than Charles and his the other half of the so called Koch brothers' political funding machine the other two brothers aren't involved in the political network or Koch Industries a reflection of decades of legal combat if you like really nasty family feud that last for decades and involved billion dollar settlements might want to read a book called Sons of Wichita how the Koch brothers became America's most powerful private dynasty Koch Industries today meanwhile is the second largest private firm in the United States after Cargill it was started by Charles Koch father as an oil an engineering firm now it's one of the biggest industrial conglomerates in the world with a hundred and twenty thousand employees deals on everything from chemicals and electronics to paper products and textiles some of its best known brands Georgia Pacific lycra and stain Master carpeting its annual revenues are estimated at about one hundred billion dollars Charles and David Koch are estimated to be worth nearly fifty billion dollars apiece Charles in case you're wondering has no interest in retiring if I did <Music/Noise> dead in six months so briefly tell me what you actually do in a in a given day well I get to work at seven or or little before and I meet with customers and meet with employees I go over <Music/Noise> projects opportunities <Music/Noise> problems and I gather information from all different sources and I'm very strong on driving innovation creative destruction and making sure <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and innovative won Koch Industries has been a gargantuan business success but that's not what made Charles Koch famous that happened much more recently when he intensified his funding of political and social causes and political campaigns because he has funded almost exclusively Republican candidates and causes typically associated with Republicans he is least in the eyes of most Democrats and obvious enemy and George Soros of the right but he and his brother David have become more than just an enemy they're seen as a bet Mar plying the radical right with so called dark money that in fact is the name of the journalist Jane Mayer's Expos say on the Koch brothers they gather around a group of four hundred to four hundred and fifty other phenomenally <Music/Noise> rich and influential American conservatives and it's given them the equivalent of kind of a private tutor Craddock political <Music/Noise> soul it's trying to untangle the rhetoric and reality and try to figure out if Charles Koch views are as Doctor Nair as are sometimes portrayed or perhaps a bit more nuance to understand his views on politics and society and business is probably helps to understand where they come from starting with his father Fred Koch studied engineering at MIT and he was tough she was Dutch and his favorite sayings you can tell the Dutch but you can't tell much in the nineteen twenties Fred Koch had a small oil refining firm that he was trying to grow into a big one he aggressively challenge the industry leader which in turn sued Koch for copying its technology eventually he would lose in court in the meantime look for business is overseas and he made his first millions building oil refining facilities in Stalin's Soviet Union which he hated the statism and collectivism cronyism and corruption what I saw in Russia Fred Koch leader Roh convinced me that communism was the most evil force the world has ever seen and I must do everything in my power to fight back home he helped start the John Birch Society which took anti communism to the point of need of ism and racism Koch also learned that the lawsuit he had last been rigged opponent fought off a judge from this one pair of events in Fred coax life getting shut down by a crooked competitor and working under the direction of a communist dictator you can see the entire blueprint for Charles Koch view of the world the enemy's cronyism special interests and intrusive government solutions what my <Music/Noise> for the good society is what we call free and open society liberated people can do amazing things here productive innovative and entrepreneurial and people who are subjugated who are intimidated controlled or dependent tend not to be Charles Koch hadn't planned on joining his father's business so he was always tough on me as a kid so I figured I'd need to go back through that again like his father Charles studied engineering at MIT after i finish of MIT I went to work for three D lol IT consulting firm and so after I'd been there two years or so my father call me and when you join the firm and I turned him down so then you are not crazy about going back to Wichita that point together yes ride and I was learning a lot having a great time playing rugby <Music/Noise> be living in Boston I mean a lot of great girls schools and the wonderful girls that they back there so I went two years to come back so then he called me and he said son he said my health is poor his blood pressure was two thirty over one twenty if you can imagine they just didn't have the drugs then of course to treat it and he said I don't have long to live in either you come back to run the company or I'm going to sell Coke agreed to come back to Wichita to take over small equipment division called Coke engineering and so that worked great so then he turned over the other areas to me and but he <Music/Noise> than he thought the live six years and I I got to work with them for six years after his father died Coke planned the firm's future someone <Music/Noise> the businesses we had and then my view as it still is is that the way to succeed is to understand what capabilities you have to create superior value find the best opportunities for him and then improve costly improve those capabilities add new ones which will open new opportunities for you so that's been our vision and our approach ever sent so we just kept building capabilities adding <Music/Noise> finding new opportunities which gave us additional capabilities and so long I see that when I look at Koch Industries employee satisfaction ratings which you can look up these days the firm does quite well but in terms of the CEO ratings that's you you do really well he met <Music/Noise> two percent approval rating now I have no idea who's writing these maybe this is you and your wife riding all the reviews know I have this first I've heard of it was good I I would rate myself quite so high but <Music/Noise> somebody is that belief so if someone in business starting I'll ask you for some structural basic advice of running a firm managing people juggling it all what would you tell them Well the first thing is to understand what your innate abilities are and what you have a passion for <Music/Noise> willing to work are at and then think through how that translates into how you create value for others because that's going to determine how successful you are and how what kind of life you have how fulfilled you are and so in an <Music/Noise> you need to create value of course first of all for your customers then you need to create value for your employees and partners and then you need to create value for society at large what excites you about the business still what keeps you coming <Music/Noise> eighties what keeps you coming into the office every day a year you one of the ten richest people on the planet so presumably don't need <Music/Noise> why I mean I I love what I love this innovation finding new <Music/Noise> to create value improving I mean I believe everything <Music/Noise> can be done much better and will be over time so that's what keeps me turn on plus helping other people transform themselves become lifelong learners and constantly <Music/Noise> how to create more value or if you've been listening to big names radio for a while folks management philosophy may sound familiar it's built on a lifetime of reading economics and other social sciences starting at MIT I became fascinated with the scientific progress the philosophy of science the scientific method and man I became fascinated with social progress as well as scientific and so I started studying economics psychology sociology and at general philosophy and then applying these principles I learned in the business and that's what ultimately <Music/Noise> to our management philosophy which is what we call Market Based Management for someone who's never heard of it let's just start with your brief description of Market Based Management Market Based Management has five dimensions vision virtue and talents knowledge processes decision rights and Senate's and when you put that together in a package an integrated package it gives leaders and everybody in the company a toolkit to solve problems and capture opportunities critical part of our mansion philosophy is building what we call a challenge culture and we find that's one of the biggest problems and acquisitions we make in many of you challenge your boss is really hurt your career here if you don't challenge your boss not to show how smart you are or be clever but because you see a problem in what's being done and or you have a better idea you believe if you don't challenge your not really doing your job I mean if you're here and as a <Music/Noise> and your people are challenging you you're obviously not a good leader because they're intimidated <Music/Noise> haven't encouraged um you <Music/Noise> there for a deal be put down or look stupid to ever worry that strong decision rights will tip into not quite anarchy but you know a two D centralized management mechanism where individual managers may have such autonomy or such decision right sadly such strong decision rights that they will turn into mini dictators right that is absolutely a danger and so what we like at great is you see in many companies they'll get centralized find that's not working so they get de centralized the way we like at it is certain things need to be centralized that is the people at the center have better <Music/Noise> of what say the effect of something on the other businesses or how that fits the overall strategy are our market trends than the people at the plant but there are other things that the people to plant have better knowledge so it's a division of labor by comparative <Music/Noise> and so we are very centralized on some things and very decentralized on others and isn't perfect and doesn't always work great no but it's a constant balance and reworking and trial and there I'd like to talk about incentives for a little bit because as you and I know that the cornerstone of a you know economic thinking so because of the way that incentives work at your firm a given employee can start making more money than his or her manager I'm curious how people respond to that does that create turmoil have you address that by course I'm not into their psyche but let me just say it works great I mean it's I mean doesn't like a basketball does the coach quit because LeBron James makes more than he said the bride go for it because you're making you're making me look good so keep it up and I hope you make five times what I do and that's the kind of culture we tried to build here so from what you're telling me now and from what I've read it sounds as if Market Based Management the operating system of your business is pretty similar to what you would like to be you personally Charles Koch would like to be the operating system for society at large a kind of structured principled environment that encourages self determination so on but but surely it's a lot harder to you know create or impose this kind of framework on society than on a private firm yes well I I mean I know what you're driving it so that the answer is yes but not structured I want a system of the spine to what I want my ideal world <Music/Noise> for it is to have truly have a society that represented the principals in the Declaration of Independence that is everyone is created equal with certain inalienable rights and governments are instituted to secure those rights and so then I like it the four core institutions in society that is education communities business and government and determine OK what is the ideal for each of these types of institutions that will help move us in that direction so back in the nineteen sixties long before you were involved politically as you are now you are good that the role of government in the capitalist system we should be quote only to keep a check on those who might attempt to interfere with the laws of supply and demand so I'm curious to hear you know how deeply you truly believe that then that the role should be that limited and how you feel about it now right well I've matured a little bit being <Music/Noise> would hope that finally so I look at government and so I stay or what is government and I I like Max Weber's definition of government the best or to its most helpful to me that is the government is the social institution with a legal monopoly on force in a given geographic area so the nature of government is force and so <Music/Noise> that government should act when force works better than voluntary cooperation competition and so the starting point on things it does is use force when force is inherent in it like to protect the country from foreign invasion police tried to protect people from being robbed and killed but that needs to be a social safety net so then the question is What is the optimum social safety net and how would that work I have to say and I say this with the utmost respect you're a total nerd aren't you know what a fun loving guy <Music/Noise> rugby player you give me but I am yeah <Music/Noise> now for many <Music/Noise> you avoided politics and <Music/Noise> you stopped avoiding it so why what changed well it was in was during the Bush administration I started <Music/Noise> and and giving that kid scholarship you're interested and self transformation <Music/Noise> self development <Music/Noise> we've been talking and then supporting professors <Music/Noise> heard about what I was interested in and so on and then got into OK we need to flesh out the policy implications of these ideas and then get into ok now <Music/Noise> of people who are interested in them we need to help them mobilize <Music/Noise> to get this stuff down and out George Bush forty three was selected and it looked like he was going to advance some of these ideas and then he went the other way and under ham government the federal government grew fifty percent more than it did under Clinton and roughly three times the number restrictive regulations were passed under him and we got in disastrous wars and just one thing after the others so well I mean we've got to have people who don't just campaign <Music/Noise> ideas but who really believe them <Music/Noise> support those who advance these ideas and and that's how it got started it in <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> coming up on Freakonomics Radio once he got started to reach broader and broader and so we had a number of successes or failures with

speaking with Charles Koch CEO of Koch Industries but much more famously one of the man behind a massive funding operation designed to blow up what Cook sees as the political status well the <Music/Noise> the let me ask you this and I don't mean to sound skeptical or snarky but why do you care personally so much about shaping society at large most people I'm guessing ninety <Music/Noise> a half percent of people listening to us talk don't know anyone that's anywhere near <Music/Noise> as wealthy and has accomplished and powerful is you and I think a natural inclination to say Well that person just wants to exert the power for ego gratification or for further enjoyment or maybe for further magnifying you know his own wealth and power so persuade me that those are not the motivations and that you're kind of desired social engineering is for the greater good we fought a revolution to get rid of royalty and we don't need road here it's seeping back and in different forms but basically I was blast starting <Music/Noise> to have learned certain principles concepts and values that transform my life and enable me to accomplish more than ever dreamed possible so sense that time I wanted to give as many people the opportunity to do the same that is to develop their full potential and become lifelong <Music/Noise> and and lead successful fulfilling lives now when somebody gets their thought <Music/Noise> that's what they're thinking about everyday that affects their whole approach to life so they think OK I want to be that my family wanted at my communities and that's just it changes their metal <Music/Noise> changes the way their brain is hardwired and that's what we find <Music/Noise> work in education and everything I have seen the side is transform or people thousands of people and so they <Music/Noise> and man as Frederick Douglas did what she got the side is he didn't just fight to free other slaves he fought for women's rights for immigrants rights for persecuted religious minorities rights and that's what we see so that's what I want people to be liberated I don't control them but why do you care so much becoz it transform <Music/Noise> and I and so I just love to see it transform other people's lives because if you have a success and you feel good about it then you want more of that and that's what I get I mean it's you can say it's like a drug but it's my hope is a drug that makes me work for good not for the list of charitable causes supported by Charles Koch and his brother David is long and diverse and would surely find approval with even the most about political enemies David is particularly well <Music/Noise> for funding the arts and medical research among the Koch Industries beneficiaries are the United Negro College Fund Project jumpstart which provides construction training and the movement for criminal justice reform well I think like everything else we need the legal system that is just for the punishment fits the crime and we also need a system that if people make a mistake learn from their mistake they need I have a second chance rather than ruin their lives now it is a is a tough sell because people believe God you're <Music/Noise> all the kernels were going to be less safe and know the idea is to make people most safe when you have draconian penalties penalties that don't fit the crime then the police are about to arrest somebody for let's say selling marijuana <Music/Noise> and you may have a gun in your car because you're afraid of being attacked so what is somebody going to do when they're going to be arrested I mean they don't have the added to that gosh okay I'm going to get a penalty but I'll be alright it's going to ruin <Music/Noise> so what do they do they fight back or run <Music/Noise> they get shot and the whole thing escalates this project aligned coke with the Obama White House in fact President Obama noted when he spoke to the NWS EP in two thousand and fifteen

freak the As an economist why <Music/Noise> interested in things like marriage and fertility things like that sigh my interest and an issues of poverty US poverty in particular I and it turns out that poverty and family structure are very intertwined in this country and so if you're thinking about the economic well being of children in particular it's really hard not to be interested in questions of family structure the eye that is Melissa Carney a professor of economics at the University of Maryland we spoke with Carney before for an episode called Is America ready for a new lose lottery and in fact in your recent national survey of thousands of one in five American adults in their greatest chance of accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars was the lottery that number jumps to forty percent for folks making less than twenty five thousand dollars of year and we spoke with her for an episode called The Early Education come way too late we find that kids are preschool age in places where they can watch Sesame Street were fourteen percent less likely to fall behind when they got elementary school so if you aren't economists trying to figure out why so many pour adults but their financial hopes in the lottery in whether Sesame Street hope spore kids do better in school makes sense to go all the way back to the start of the lifecycle marriage and fertility or lot of cases just fertility <Music/Noise> sixty five percent of births and the US were to unmarried mothers ok that was five percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers in nineteen sixty fast forward now to two thousand and fourteen in two thousand fourteen over forty percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers so first of all how the anything that spikes from five percent to forty percent is big change but we're talking about something as elemental as family structure that mean the kits are being born to less educated single moms they are falling farther and farther behind that probably doesn't surprise you decades of social science research have confirmed the sad fact but it may surprise you certain surprise Melissa Kearney was what some fascinating new data told her about marriage and fertility <Music/Noise> she's pretty sure would confirm a hunch she had she's pretty sure it would offer some good news and facts the data showed the opposites the <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> the the link between family structure and poverty something academic researchers like Melissa Carney known about for a long time thus really hard for researchers to establish the cause all the facts of family structure or marriage and kids outcomes of course because we don't randomly assign kids to married or unmarried parents bites there's a lot of research that works really hard to sort of isolate factors and that research consistently shows that I can to have with two <Music/Noise> parents you have lower rates of poverty a higher sort of cognitive test scores in childhood have fewer behavioral problems they seem to have better health outcomes are less likely to live in poverty when they're twenty five or more likely to complete college and they're less likely to become a young unmarried parents themselves and what is your marital and maternal status I am a married mother and thirty am but that does not make me a biased researcher year and so you share use are you not shaming everybody else by imposing your social mask and play unfair if people don't want you know I'm not saying anybody should get married who doesn't wanna get married what I'm saying is that we see in the data that kids are born to married mothers have better short term and long term outcomes were the <Music/Noise> these days roughly four million babies are born each year in the U S That's a fertility rate of sixty two babies every one thousand women of what's called prime childbearing age fifteen forty four if you go back sixty years to the baby boom call that for reason the rate of child bearing is nearly double so that's one big change in the fertility picture another one as Carney <Music/Noise> so in nineteen sixty five percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers in two dozen fourteen over forty percent of births and the US were unmarried mothers yet this is really a dramatic increase and if you're convinced as Carney is that kids in unmarried households have worse outcomes well bad news and and the forty percent sort of masks really high rates in particular groups so seventy one percent of births to African American mothers now are outside marriage seventy one percent of births to women under the age of twenty five outside of marriage the concern about African American kids in single parent homes has been around for long time not allowed a bad situation in the pool but rather a bad situation worse it's Daniel Patrick Moynihan sociologist turned politician became a longtime Democratic senator from New York but before that nineteen sixties he worked in the Labor Department where he co wrote a report came to be known as The Moynihan Report its official name using the nomenclature of the time was The Negro Family The Case for National Action about the royal family headed by women the divorce rate is to nap time as an only the the the number of fatherless children keep going his argument was that room and do better this is a father in the home and Rachel in a sociologist at Johns Hopkins he saw a rise in single Parenthood in children living without fathers in the home I saw the rez bigger among African Americans he focused on them how'd you learn how to be a father a mother and your older sister people around you there is no spot where children are just brought up without any of that support the family gives the reporter as you can imagine was controversial when it was clear that racism was a significant factor and the lack of good jobs was a big problem got to get him and the way can a man can run a family that lived up to the stock very sick with Adam we have to have helped out just tell this country that but Moynihan argued that it was all about economics as he wrote quote The fundamental problem is that a family structure evidence not final but powerfully persuasive is that the Negro family in urban ghettos is crumbling so long as this situation persists the cycle of poverty and disadvantage will continue to repeat itself but here's the difference and are true and again that can lay hands day this was an issue relating to poor people and African Americans the issue truly means of single parent families it's still the case that there are lots of such families so if you think of the stereotypical unmarried mother <Music/Noise> sixty five you might think an unmarried teenager living <Music/Noise> who'd likely be from a minority group if you think of the typical unmarried mother today she's white she's in her twenties and she's probably living with the guy who's the father of the chiller that's the big change that we've seen that huge shift in the middle the rate of unmarried births to non Hispanic white women is nearly thirty percent now triple what it was in nineteen eighty so that is a big shift but as Melissa Carney points out the most powerful predictor of single motherhood is education level fewer than ten percent of births to women with a college degree are outside marriage as compared to roughly sixty percent of births to a man with a high school degree or with the Lassen High School degree this surge in unmarried births among low education women seems to present a double whammy number one these kids are likely born into a household with one income at most and number two since low education moms to have low incomes that means fewer resources no one of course is looking to beat up on low income single parent families it's also considered bad form at least in some circles to prescribe marriage as a solution Melissa Kearney gets that but she also gets that the so called marriage premium is legit I am perfectly comfortable saying that it looks I being born to two you are living with two married parents is beneficial for kids and I <Music/Noise> acted and say don't wanna see that right because it sounds really socially conservative and preachy but I think was really interesting is if you think of how higher educated higher income parents are behaving they are still almost entirely having children inside of marriage both parents are investing an extraordinary amount of both financial resources but time and energy into their kids and so you know in some sense it's a luxury to be able to say Oh I don't want to make social commentary like that well that's because the kids of higher educated higher income parents they're doing extremely well but the kids are being born to less educated single moms they are falling farther and farther behind and so to not be honest about the ailing is doing anybody any favors even if it's politically more comfortable <Music/Noise> so the big question what does cause this huge spike in unmarried births one obvious fact consider is that marriage itself has become a lot less popular in the US we looked at the many <Music/Noise> for this in a two part For Economics radio episode is called Why Mary and a lot of unmarried couples of course live together still what accounts for so many more unmarried births among mothers with less education social conservatives tend to point to the breakdown of old school social norms social liberals cite less access to contraception although that has improved a lot and especially the lack of economic opportunity that is man without good jobs are eager to marry or from the other end of the equation they are considered good husband material Alyssa Carnes world this is called The Marriage of Elm and fury I said that's based on this idea that's been around since William Julius Wilson's really seminal work in the nineteen eighty is arguing that this decline in the economic security of less educated man and in certain populations are demographic groups in particular is behind this rise in non marital childbearing in retreat from marriage will do a bit of those days you can find a guy who's got a decent steady income but those guys have been disappearing because the the industrial jobs that used to have her no <Music/Noise> are in church or live again the people in the middle that hurt the most by the changes our economy it's the factory jobs that used to employ people with high school degrees that have moved overseas or been caught in it so that's the theory that the unmarried birth spike is due at least in large part to a shrinking pool of men with good stable employment and so and so sort of hypothesized in the reverse I've been keen to find a situation where we've seen an improvement and less educated man's economic situation the accent straight only Melissa Kearney could find a scenario like that where less educated men suddenly had a job and wage boost and the fracking them adding constitutes the rare context where black men without a college degree have seen an improvement and their employment and earnings prospects in recent years so that gave us a place to look at how family formation outcomes responded great and I'm just curious as a researcher do you get really excited when you see you know in the news something like the fracking boom because you know it'll provide some great variable some shocks to the system that you'll then exploit to answer some research questions yeah it's it's always a joke among them para ka AI researchers you see some shock and you know whether it's red with anger now the society he has an open question but do you know you can help this instinctive thought of food that provides great exhaustion is variation that I can explain and so the fracking boom these look wise cracking them is really having sort of meets our standard in the sense that it's determined by preexisting Geological formations in the earth and even the most you know pursue kitty economists will tend to grants that whether there is this Geological formation under your county is probably exhaustion is to fail information preferences <Music/Noise> exhaustion is a family formation preferences meaning what exactly the concern in trying to figure out how economic conditions affect things like family formation outcomes is that if you see a place where the men are working and have high wages and you want to relate that to their rates of marriage there's always an issue of O will the kind of <Music/Noise> live there and have steady jobs those are the exactly the kind man who would make good husbands and fathers and so this isn't really independent variation but when you take the place and all of us Aiden because of this technological innovation in the early two thousands all of the side and the geology under the county becomes really economically value of all such that now there's an economic boom <Music/Noise> likely to get jobs and have higher earnings potential that's really independent and to other aspects of sort of who's living there and family formation and other related preference as fracking or hydraulic fracturing is a technique to extract oil and gas from the earth around for many decades but as Carney notes technological innovations led to a fracking boom in the early two thousands the ramifications have been huge environmentally it's been great concern about pollution destabilization critics of fracking say it harms the environment they worry that the method contaminate groundwater there's also been a massive shift in global petroleum markets the US started producing so much oil and gas that reclaimed its title as the top oil producing country in the world this led to economic and geopolitical scrambling and Saudi Arabia Russia and elsewhere Alyssa Carney wasn't concerned about these huge changes not much at least the fracking boom was for her

called male earnings marriage able men and non marital fertility evidence from the fracking boom the central idea if the disappearance of good jobs for less educated men of the past few decades was a contributing factor in huge spike in unmarried births may be an economic stake among less educated man would lead to a rise in Mary Burke's first thing to consider is how economists think about childbearing decisions the <Music/Noise> people have greater levels of income are less equal we should expect they should have more children but we also know that there's a price effects of kids are expensive so if the price of having kids goes up for the price of child rearing goes up and expect people will have fewer kids fewer choices in having children correspond very much the way that they correspond with you know buying a new car versus use car no car tall and so on I was afraid in assets and I don't know that of the top my head but I do think the evidence is pretty strong at this point there a <Music/Noise> of rigorous studies showing that when there are some sort of exhaustion is shocked in hand we see an increase in fertility so for example a paper I wrote a couple years ago with our graduates in at the time Lisa dat lame we found that during the housing boom homeowners had more kids and mentors had fewer kids and that's totally consistent with people who own a house saw their home equity went up the case in terms of job you or wage boom how does fracking compare ok so I am these fracking games have been touted as creating tens of thousands of jobs in providing starting salaries at fifty thousand dollars for recent high school graduates with average earnings for folks are actually working in oil and gas extraction jobs of between seventy thousand and eighty thousand and also there's positive spillover errors in nearby counties so it's important to realize that the positive economic shock coming from local fracking is not limited to folks who are working in fracking jobs there's a local economic booms and other industries also see an uptick in business so tell us just a bit about the data how many locations are we talking about generally and then in terms of trying to measure the relationship between income and childbearing and marriage and all that where those data all coming from her someday be clear that we're not looking at North Dakota and Montana and what's called the The Bakken region up there I think that captures a lot of the public imagination or attention when it comes to thinking about fracking you're not looking at them because the scenarios to pronounce there it's two migratory exactly we're not looking at them because it's a really unique situation up there where a lot of the fracking jobs were filled by in incline migrants and so I North decoder the counties that fracking their their populations increase significantly in response to the fracking boom so it's a very different setting where looking instead add add Pennsylvania Oklahoma tax S West Virginia Ohio and number of other places where there wasn't really a large migration response where looking at data from the early two thousand and during this period nine hundred and sixty six counties in the US had new fracking wells and weeds he means thrill level information from a private company that sells this day that we know the exact location of every well and when it started rolling and then we link that was his government data on wages and jobs as well as I fight the statistics data on the universe of person the US and on census data about marriage is an eye rates of cohabitation so there's a lot of data being pulled together for this analysis so the underlying idea is that one reason fewer mothers have been getting married over the past few decades because fewer men have good economic prospects and therefore if there's a job boom or wage boom that would theoretically increase the supply of men with better economic prospects yes that's kind of the theory that you want to test that was the hypothesis that three Okay And how that work out what did you actually learn from your data set I know my speculation going in was that an increase in that the economic opportunities for men would lead to a reduction in amount of ang and in fact the data so the opposites or let say didn't support that so the data do show that in response to these increase economic activity and earnings potential we do see an increase in births but interesting Lee there's the same response unmarried births and non married Doris and no increase and marriage so this does not offer support for what I'll call a reverse marriage a womans story where as if we see more marriage able manner that will see an increase in marriage at that the data do not support that ok so there is a fertility boom when there's a fracking boom How big is the fertility boom and can you compare it to the size of the fracking boom yet so what our estimate suggests is that an additional thousand dollars of fracking production per capita is innocent is associated with an increase of six births per thousand only God yet know the other babies I know that's consistent with previous evidence so I think one of the most interesting things in our research was a comparison into the coal boom and bust situation it's a similar economic shock it's a similar industry it there and similar sort of area as the Appalachian region is impose a similar employment cohort then as well re education wise age wise stuff like that that's right is just a different period so the coal boom and bust happen and seventies and eighties and what we find is that a ten percent increase in earnings associated with the coal boom led to very similar sized fat increases and married birth rates but as in the fracking them like an eight percent increase in marital birth rates for ten percent increase in earnings that call them and a twelve percent increase unmarried birth rates associated the fracking boom but the non marital births response is very different so a ten percent increase in earnings associated with coal them actually lead to a reduction in non marital births but it's twelve percent increase in non marital births was is it you know with that ten percent increase in earnings associated with fracking so that's where the reall the response differed and in the earlier period when earnings increases in with a cold room marriage increased and as we've been saying there's no increase for the fracking boom I know coal boom produced more marriage and more kids in fewer kids born to unmarried moms where the fracking boom produced more kids but no <Music/Noise> and a lot more kids born to unmarried moms yet harsh an increase and married <Music/Noise> married person the fracking them so I mean we speculated that a you know this suggests that social context is really important to determining their response to economic changes in understand that so in the seventies and eighties very few births or outside of marriage and there was a social stigma associated with non married births and so in the seventies and eighties when you got more income it looks like you had more births but only if you are married and now reading period were non marital births are extremely calm and in the last educated populations and so now we see is if you get more income you have more babies for a fight but it doesn't matter whether you're married or not that's a real difference to Howell <Music/Noise> is the fracking industry ok so that's a good question so I I don't know the specifics but what I can say is we do confirm the data add that the increase in wages and job opportunities are twice as large for man as for women in these areas and that's important to keep in mind because we would expect that I'm the sort of marriage birth response is to see now versus male economic opportunities would be different I'm curious whether these jobs in this industry is seen as more cyclical or less durable than other industries yet we wondered about that so in the data do show that the impacts of new production and wages are persistent so two years after the initial fracking drilling begins in a county two thirds of the wage income is persistent and so it doesn't seem to be a case that sort of summer comes and facts in a county in leaves right away well yeah but I'm thinking if I'm getting the job or if I'm planning to marry someone who's getting that job I may think wow this is a great job and great income right now but given the nature of the industry it may be a two or three year boom and that's and that's and I'm just curious how that might change your <Music/Noise> or childbearing prospects at that rate so that's one of the potential explanations for why we don't find a marriage a fact is that maybe these positive economic shock is thought to be temporary and you know the potential male partners going to go back to being unemployed are having low wages in a couple years so there's a couple thoughts I have on that the first is if people really thought this was just temporary it's surprising then that there's a fertility response right because we do see that this is fracking boom led to an increase in earnings and let that lead to increased childbearing so there would still have to be some asymmetry there is I'm not saying it's impossible but I think it's curious is surprising especially if however you're assuming that the fertility is intentional though I mean if you just thinking about jobs means money which means opportunities to do things like Intel go out and drink in bars and meet people and have sex that's different than having a fertility plan that's all I'm saying that their marital births response is sort of the same size as the non marital births response so married couples are also increasing their fertility in response to this and less inclined to think that that's unintentional <Music/Noise>

<Music/Noise> in our previous episode we look to the study that explored the links between jobs and family structure the findings were surprising and frankly little bit depressing it turns out that the fracking boom which has provided a lot of good jobs for less educated men also lead to a mini baby boom as economics would predict people tend to have more kids when their financial circumstances are solid but economics would also predict that when people's financial circumstances improve they're more likely to form families not just have babies but that did not happen about forty percent of the babies born in the US these days are born to unmarried mothers it's a huge increase of the past few decades coming into the fracking study the researchers had suspected and hoped that good jobs with lead to more stable families it didn't and as you likely know kids born into less stable families are at much higher risk for bad outcomes in life education health income you name it so the next question becomes if more and more of these at risk kids are being born how can society best help them that is what today's episode is about we will begin briefly in Los Angeles so let's start by if you would just say your name and what you do I'm Greg Boyle in I'm a Jesuit priest and I'm the founder and executive director of homeboy Industries which is the largest gang intervention rehab re entry program on the planet father Boyle and homeboy Industries are kind of legendary they've been celebrated over the years G Dawg is Father Greg Boyle of thirty seven Euro jazz would present on that another person inside of us went on his campaign we could become the citizen meetings since there is no place on the planet Earth for more gang members show up to redirect their lives to get some help to begin all over again oil started homeboy in nineteen eighty eight when I was pastor very poor parish and we have eight Kings at war with each other things have gotten somewhat better since then I'm going to bury the guy who was killed but in this high speed chase on Saturday so be my two hundred and eighteen gang member that I've had to bury but it's nothing like the bad old days when I'd have eight funerals in the three week period homeboy caters to gang members have gotten out of prison their motto is Nothing stops a bullet like a job so we have a bakery several restaurants farmers markets but then we have programs alongside like tattoo removal anger management and jobs program trying to find family friendly employers to employ enemies working side by side with each other Boyle preaches what he calls boundless compassion and by that measure homeboy Industries would seem to be a raging success how concerned is he with more traditional outcomes if you're driven by outcomes you're going to only work with a population that will give you good ones you know we're going to work with the most belligerent different cold hearted songs they walk through the door ok but big question How well does a program like this really work and somebody might say to me what how do you know that it works and I would say again no place on the planet Earth has more gamers walk through the door trying to get help and the reason I say that is no gang member would walk through the door if this place didn't help if it didn't somehow were the <Music/Noise> story of Father Boyle and homeboy Industries is inspiring for sure tell that well in a book called tattoos on the heart but his answer about how well homeboy the works no gang member would walk through the door if this place didn't help if it didn't somehow work that doesn't really constitute proof does for that you need to measure outcomes more objectively more scientifically maybe even set up a control group that you could compare the treatment group I say this with no disrespect the Father Boyle and others like him that's not the business they're in but in a world where so many rate hearted people spend so much time and money interventions meant to help other people would be nice to understand which ones work and which ones don't maybe even understand When helping hurts today on Radio one of the earliest modern attempts to find out what really does help at risk kids the program crafted scientific methods on to a social action program that study is one of the bedrock studies in the prevention of crime it was just it was very innovative at the time it's also the story of a tenacious researcher who chased down the data decades later it was a little bit like a mystery and you're trying to track people down and every time you found someone it felt like a little treasure hunt and the conclusions people just assume that if you do something that sounds good that it's the positive effects but it's actually it's actually more complicated than that with no exaggeration it is still shocking to this day the the sauce The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the The The The The long before her father Greg Boyle and homeboy Industries in all the others like them there was a civic minded Harvard physician named Richard Clarke at the Richard Clarke as it was just a fascinating character that's Brandon Welsh criminology at northeastern University and for the stone eons he was a member of the Calvert family so the cabinets in the lodge is very distinguished family Richard cabin was a philanthropist and Doctor and very much committed to helping people and committed to figuring out what method really worked and that is Jeff say or McCord philosophy professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and he was quite revolutionary in thinking we ought to be taking the same care when we intervene with people's lives as we do when we intervene with their bodies during the Great Depression have commissioned what came to be known as the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study one of the unique features of this study was initiated back in in the thirties was to be a longitudinal survey perspective of tuna survey the purpose of which was what he wanted it to be tested over a very lengthy pre of time something that by today's standards is is unheard of the study would last so long technically it's still going on today and Brandon Welch is now its director yes it's now been recognized as the first randomized experiment of a social program that had been a few earlier experiments in education but nothing like this in social work or crime prevention what drove cab he was appalled by the recidivism <Music/Noise> from the Boston juvenile Court and key really saw that there was a need to move outside of the treatment regime outside of attending two after the fact and so he really coined this view of prevention in the first instance and he was quite convinced but didn't have the evidence to support his being convinced that what we now call mentoring was a fact if Jeff Sayre McCord as you'll hear later on also has an intimate connection to the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study through his late mother who was a criminology us anyway Doctor Cabot idea was that boys and young men headed for trouble could benefit from some mentoring yes so the treatment was larger for two s directed friendship so hoping to get evidence that mentoring would be helpful he went to Cambridge and Somerville at the time of very poor neighborhoods and he identified roughly two hundred and fifty at risk kids is talking to preachers teachers and parents which kids seem to be having trouble and then he also identified two hundred and fifty kids who seem to be doing while in the control group received no special services of the They were what we would call and no treatment control group and basically information about who they were was recorded but there was no intervention with so the boys were first matched their diagnostic pairs maybe he would match you and I because we lived in the same neighborhood and we came from families that were the same size and had the same income and then he flips a coin basically it randomly assigns one person from each of the match pairs to a control group and then in the treatment group are their match partners ok ok so the control group is either a kid doing well working not doing well matched with the opposite one goes in control when those in treatment that race so far that's exactly right that's exactly right and then the treatment took a broad range it was basically councilors who would visit the family counselors would meet every couple weeks with the boys interact with them and help them with homework and take them to the YMCA <Music/Noise> and during the summer months of some of the treatment group voice or able to go to summer camps and so were sent out of the city so that it was Big Brother Big Sister it was kind of mentoring that still is celebrated it lasted from nineteen thirty nine to nineteen forty five so what you had at the end of the Cabot study was this voluminous set of records here's his treasure trove of data with controls and that's O Most nonexistent in social interventions that you have data on a controller the <Music/Noise> ok so the wise is important because whenever you're trying to establish cause and effect in anything whether it's a chemical reaction or something like this a mentorship program for at risk young men need to be able to isolate the inputs and reliably measure the outputs that's a lot easier to do and chemistry than it is with something as complicated as people's lives which is why a lot of the ideas you hear about in the field like criminology tend to be more theoretical than care so that when I started in this field they were I thinks thirteen different ideas about how to prevent delinquency and very little empirical research on any of them it's Denise got Princeton professor in the Department of criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland got France and started out in the field even something as basic as good measurement was elusive so it was for example quite difficult to study schools because they didn't have the instruments to measure things and we just didn't have the technology to measure a lot of different schools in the same way so it was heartening to learn about the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study that study is one of the bedrock studies in the prevention of crime all students learn about it it was just it was very innovative at the time Joan records work to follow up those five hundred youth was just I mean a study like that was very rare in those days ok so Joan McCord was a young criminal a just a couple generations before conference and here's McCord on tape from nineteen ninety six during a period of the nineteen fifty when I was a graduate student I had walked into <Music/Noise> that was filled with records this was while I was on American beef research a sister Eleanor McCabe was a renowned psychologist at Harvard and Stanford who worked on child development and McAfee study was asking mothers to report on how they treated their children and have their children behave the minute you hear that you probably think Wait a minute asking someone about their behavior in the best way to measure behavior is that that's exactly what John McCord was thinking as she was coating the survey responses and I was Cody and thought that it was a shame to believe what mothers had to say about what they did when you can't be objective the vacuum around <Music/Noise> so when Joe McCord heard about the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study which was launched more than a decade earlier she got excited because it had been set up to avoid a lot of the typical problems in social science research first of all it was a bona fide randomized controlled trial which meant you could isolate the effects of the intervention and it also afforded the opportunity to look at long term effects using objective measurements for instance did the kids who got mentorship tend to stay outta trouble get better jobs where they less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol take a lot of work but McCord knew those questions were answerable I applied for grants as a credit record got the grant in fact she would go on to become director of the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study as Brandon Welch is today along the way she taught at Drexel and Temple universities in nineteen eighty eight she became the first female president of the American Society of criminology but back in the nineteen fifties when she began to look into the Cambridge Somerville data she wasn't even the first scholar to do such an analysis so that the first one took place in nineteen forty eight Brandon Walsh again by now the boys from the study the boys were in their early twenties on average and the findings were of a resoundingly <Music/Noise> no effect or the didn't detect any differences and delinquency friend Dean of between the treatment of control groups said that must've been a little bit surprising and disappointing correct indeed it was quite surprising now in the late nineteen fifties Joan record comes along working in partnership with her then husband who was a sociologist these boys were now young man embarking on careers <Music/Noise> engaged in careers and so there was this opportunity to examine one was in a with the program effective could even be a sleeper effect and then two as part of Bill the longer follow up phase of the research and so in the fifties records found what similar findings they found no effect that they found they were no differences between the treatment and control voice online Fendi so that's not very encouraging is that a mentorship program for troubled boys seems to have no long term upside the story might have ended there quite an dramatically were it not for a dramatic technological innovation computers came on the scene and my mom was a really keen to exploit that new resource and had the mathematical ability <Music/Noise> empirical commitment to learn the programming and run the data let's just say are McCourt again she thought once you had that resource you be able to uncover the positive effect she was convinced would be there these boys were now men on their mid forties so she saw a great opportunity to follow up on the inspired commitment to doing social science with as a controlled study and you know was in the grip of at that when I got to college I volunteered as a mentor is a Big Brother UK due in <Music/Noise> inspired by essentially this idea inspired by this program oh yeah and I love doing it I love hanging out with kids and this show and I knew his mother and who to work that the college I went to he was ten or twelve he was right in that age and his father was had been in jail it was mostly tutoring and hanging out and oh you're playing soccer and at the same time I was involved in trying to track down people when my mom start doing follow up with this <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> that's right Joan McCord had enlisted her son help track down the men who nearly thirty years earlier had been boys in the Cambridge Somerville you study it was now the nineteen seventies the world was very different back then no internet no cell phones et-cetera that's Richard Perle rent A records research assistant at the time was also helping track down these men so we really <Music/Noise> physical telephone books on searches of official government records that the name Doctor McCord had gained access to such as the provider statistics Massachusetts We were all figure out where they had lived in and finding doing searches in the library to find people with the same <Music/Noise> in roughly the same communities to be dialing <Music/Noise> that you introduce yourself say I'm trying to re <Music/Noise> sew in so did you use to live in Cambridge at this address and having confirmed him and said You know I'm working for the Cambridge Somerville you study we'd like to contact you so when everywhere from Maine to Florida to California at least twice a lot of guys when we ask them my asked them why it was they had been up in Arizona or California or whatever May said have you been the summer horrible place a good way to gather it was a little bit like a mystery and you're trying to track people down and every time you found someone that felt like a little treasure hunt she found ninety eight percent of the people from the study it kind of boggles the mind to think either are or how hard she worked or how lucky she got her some combination of both can you explain <Music/Noise> eight is so high it is quite astonishing couple factors working in favor of the first one was that about eighty percent of the participants still residing in Massachusetts at roughly age forty five they were These are one of the fine and I guess probably low income is correlated with low mobility very much still very much so another important part was that Joan began or continued this meticulous record keeping so the last known address last known phone number of these participants so she had started to build in in what we would call today a database she was a compulsive note taker whether it's before Google there was your mom that's exactly right I love the way of thinking about and so for example if we found from talking to a young family member for example that when the subject from the program had died Doctor McCord shouldn't consider the case was closed until she actually had documentation physical documentation we had one guy in particular who his whole family told us that he died a car accident in Canada so for more <Music/Noise> Doctor Cort encourage me to track this guy and I was <Music/Noise> you want Doctor McCord been a real pain the neck years everybody the family home these days you'll be chasing of damaged a ghost she was meticulous she was dog eared and then I had a hunch that maybe I'll try looking at the Motor vehicle records for the state must choose and I found a record of this guy in Massachusetts that was recent and by luck one of the numbers I had a cold and somebody else I'd spoken to answer the phone this time and this person told me that the guy wasn't in fact he was still in Cambridge I actually think I interviewed in a bar and um he's basically said that his family had disowned him from when he went into prison leaked to the soaked McCord and her research assistants tracked down nearly all the participants from the long go study they interviewed the men asking them all sorts of questions about how their lives it turned out nearly every interview and one thing in common their memories <Music/Noise> of the mentoring were overwhelmingly positive you'd get people saying oh it was one of the best things that happened in my lie whatever happened to my mentor and a lot of them made unsolicited comments like If envy for those guys <Music/Noise> NEVER been this person already gone to prison in all kinds of different positive things they attributed back to their council action or experience in addition to the interviews McCord also went after lots of other data on the subjects she got access to all sorts of amazing records and there were a bunch of measures seventy in particular that are worth mentioning death records criminal records mental health records and health records alcoholism and then job satisfaction in marital satisfaction can get that data today presumably unless you hack into insurance database maybe yeah exactly it's available just not legally I'm sure what was her level of you know I guess enthusiasm like at this point when she realizes that she can actually make a comparison and make a measurement about how the treatment where she was clearly animated by the thought that if you can find the causes you're in a better position to find treatments and the vindication of your work is to do that that's what excited her <Music/Noise> by the The Coming up on for comics radio so what did McCord and her intrepid team finally find it was so surprising that began from scratch a second

would think this is going to be a career like this is what you're going to do with your life but that is not what happened no it's it's not I could have gone to been a script supervisor or production quite in a dare associate producer perhaps I'm on the operational side of things and that is what I thought I was reasonably happy doing great I was ecstatic as wonderful and I think because I was very happy at what I was doing with work when I had my down time and I was not at work I didn't have that desperate feeling that you feel when you're like Oh God I'm finally not at work and I just wanna relax I just wanna eat vege out you know so I became creative <Music/Noise> was at home <Music/Noise> had the idea to start making beauty products even occur to you well what initially happened was I'm a huge Prince <Music/Noise> have been for many years and I read an article about him and in that article they talked about how he always smells very good and the reason for it was he kept the assortment of fragrances on his bureau and it was also rumored that he put Chanel Number five in his boots so that whenever he took off his boots he didn't have to worry about his feet not smelling good how I could I could see Princeton the the boat I did love this idea of this blending of fragrances in creating these unique scent that you were thinking about this as a business now do for free you just like just to do for me and that's what I began to do I learned that the way that your fragrance lasts on your body is you layer and so you wash with it you moisturize with it then you spritz and I Then I said Well I don't have which rises that smell like this where my gonna get that and at first I started using lotions that I could get the drug store and I would put fragrances into them and and blend it it didn't work that that wasn't you know ballots from a chemistry perspective so things which is separate and be kind of messy and that led me into looking into possibly making my own and one day I walked into this like new age kind of bookstore and there was a book on essential oils in the art of perfume Marie and in that book were a basic recipes for a massage oil or cream or a bomb so then I thought this is great I can make my own lotions and I know the recipes were very like bare bones and you know they use things like Paris Finland <Music/Noise> which I wasn't to the crazy about using my I wanted to use beeswax and I wanted to find cocoa butter I use the skeleton of the recipes within the book and that I just started adding my own combinations and tweak it you know if something came out runny or too thick or too oily or too stiff flashy you are like literally melting down cocoa butter on stove top and I'm like cooking up things and me using oils together and then seeing what came out yes wow so that's that's a big body butter and a belt a bunch of stuff and mix it together yet I be today you couldn't get Oh go on you to get the DIY videos in and get a good head start but back then it is kind had to figure it out and this was this was like What the the late eighties early nineties that was the late eighties I began selling because I had actually gotten something that you know looked good in work and my mother encouraged me to sell a church flea market in May of ninety three wishing she was saying Hey Lisa the stuff is pretty cat like your You should sell this people might buy and that that is pretty much verbatim what you <Music/Noise> by this is a there you go I did not really Mommy do you think people would pay for this she said yes she said You're butters are good that you know my skin <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> it on my little brothers and sisters and she said I think you should try and I remember saying to my mama says Mom what am I going to put them in because I just would give it to friends and family <Music/Noise> I put in Tupperware or Rubbermaid I found a jar and she said Well we could use recycled baby food jars <Music/Noise> my mom <Music/Noise> my baby sister Torah very recently so she had lots of baby food jars allow and we you <Music/Noise> oil the one the stove like I use to effect either idols back in the day I put the cream in the baby food jars and <Music/Noise> made my labels by hand <Music/Noise> took them out to the flea market and I sold out what you would call that point I call the company Carol's Daughter I did have a name and I called the Carol's Daughter because that's literally who I was my mom was Carol and I was her daughter and the products that I sold I called them frequent moisture butter at the time CU show for this remarkable you are still a writer's assistant on the Cosby Show display this like your weekend side hustle right now by ninety three cars B had ended and I I so I was a freelance person but it was summer TV typically in New York was very slow in the summer months because you're seasons would end in May and your new season wouldn't begin until September so unless you are working on a pile it you are probably off during the summer and that first summer of starting at that flea market at the end of May I spent most of that summer making money selling at different craft fairs and Expos and things like that and I went back to work that fall what did you how much money did you have to put a end to like watch this thing that very first flea market honestly was an investment of one hundred dollars between you know whatever the table rental was in the ingredients that I had to purchase to fill the baby food jars that I had and maybe some flowers to decorate my table and what I did I just kept re investing because I didn't have money that I could say all I'm just going to go pull ten thousand at my savings to start this business so it was something that started in a very small way very organic way and I didn't do anything that I couldn't afford to do so if if someone told me about an expo in Georgia that's fantastic and the fee to get it is only five thousand dollars I wasn't going there but a table you know in Park slope for thirty five bucks okay with the who's who who your customers in that first summer they were mostly African American women that you know we're in the different neighborhoods that I was kinda I did have some customers who weren't African American vote for the most part that's who we come to my table I I was not deliberately saying this is for African American women I was deliberately saying this is for dry skin and subsequently when you have more melanin in your skin that dry skin will show you you look dull feel of the day a year as people say she and you cannot get away from that and that's how I probably at that time ended up with that audience of people who were more frown because they found something that took away that cash so if you if you if you're African American woman in the early nineteen nineties essentially there was a very few options it is really a few companies or serving your needs or wants yes very few there was definitely a community that needed to be served who was not necessarily being served it was it was not something that you could walk into a drugstore and say Look at that this is fantastic great it wasn't there it is now but it wasn't and so that summer of ninety three when you are like selling Body Butter in baby jars at church Lee markets did you think of this is you know as your future just think of this come a fun little side project that I'm doing and I get to hang out with people I know and says I'm having fun at first I thought about it as fine and then August of that summer I was watching an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show yeah and she was talking to people who had started businesses with little or no money and one person said Well you have to know that you're passionate about what you do you can start a business just because you wanna make a bunch of money because it's going to take too long for you to make any money and if you're not passionate about it you went before you make any money and I remember <Music/Noise> I'm really passionate about the <Music/Noise> had like I like doing this and then somebody else said she would define passion as if someone woke you up out of your bed in the middle of the night would you go into this thing and I honestly could answer yes to that question <Music/Noise> who is very fond <Music/Noise> I love a good you know leagues been kind of thing and I realized I would get out of it to do this because I really do enjoy it and I remember sitting on the edge of my bed and saying wait a minute maybe this is the This could be a business and that day was the day that <Music/Noise> this just doesn't have to be a hobby this can be more so that first summer and and you go back to a job and he the hunt and what happens to us to the business to kill it continues to grow people call and say hey hey I've bought a jar cream from you you know let such and such street fair and I'm running out How can I get some more and I would look at my schedule and you know if I'd knew I was going to be home on a Saturday as well if you are to come by my apartment on Saturday I'll be home and working the rest of the week but I'll be home one Saturday what time would you like to come by and that was the beginning of people coming and shopping in my apartment and that continued to grow to the point where sometimes I would come home and asking Massachusetts peak if someone didn't know that it was an actual guest or he'd only heard about it from a friend and you know you're getting your answering machine at home yet so at this point how did you get the word out about Carol's Daughter because initially you were you know yet that the flea markets and people are talking but how did you get more people to know but really you know my my husband calls this The Sister Girl Network it was literally one woman telling another woman and somebody always brought a friend with them and if you brought a friend you know get a free gift or you know something off it was all of that grass roots type of stuff and if I was out selling somewhere and someone asked me about something I didn't know how to make it I figured out how to make it so I learned how to make bath salts I learned how to make body scrubs different types of moisturizers I've figured out how to make shampoo had make conditioner it was it was just experimenting the way you would experiment cooking and when did you decide to leave TV and just do this full time I left television in nineteen ninety six because my son Forrest was due to be born April fifth of that year and I realize that if I continued to work I would basically just give my paycheck to a babysitter yet so it just logically made sense to let the job cull and see if in being at home full time while taking care of a baby could the business grow enough we also at the same time we were able to change how and where we live so on and uncle were selling their home they were selling it to someone else and I think there were three tries at the closing and it just didn't happen and I finally worked up the nerve to ask Is there any way that we could purchase your home and we did it and so Forrest was born March eighteen ninety six and made twenty second of ninety six we moved into the home that we live in today and it enabled us to you know have the space that we needed with the baby but also have space for the business to grow and that was that was a big turning point you know it was a huge difference so many people coming in on Saturdays to shop you know there was a time where you would be like ohh i die in Hi <Music/Noise> Charles and out was like I don't know any of you I never met you before the voice mailbox would fill up every hour and half my husband and I was you know wait to food when did you last checked the phone so I checked it to thirty oh my god it's five o'clock the debt limit let get me a pen and paper and is he just he just look at it in and he can't he can't believe the <Music/Noise> price in just a moment how mention from Oprah crash the company's website guy writing listening to how I built this PR hey

gonna love it you can find wow in the world on Apple podcasts at NPR dot org slash wow or however you get your podcasts the <Music/Noise> in the neck to hide this from NPR guy rise after Lisa started to focus on Carol's Daughter full time the things started to take off pretty fast the what was turning play when did you when did something happen and where you thought Oh my God this is like the time well because I've been in business for twenty four years and because turning points and success and you know those aha moments are very relative and fluid there's been several of those so you know there was there with the moment when my second son Ennis was born and I was in the hospital after having given birth and my husband walks into the hospital with essence magazine and I was in the November issue and I actually had half page article with picture and my name which was a really big deal had they know about it find out about it there but there were beauty editors that lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood where I lived so they were always in search of something different and then because I worked in television production for so long then my husband continue to instill does I would have access to Make Up Artists and Hair stylists and if they you know went by in another production they could reach out to me and I could send it to them I remember hearing that edi Falco loved moisturizer of mine because a makeup artist that I worked with on and show shared it with or you know and I was like ee kay Poh wreath I've never met any valuable to this day but she She loved one of my moisturizer wow so so by nineteen eighty nine you guys were able to open up like an actual shop right yes the first store that was not in my house brick and mortar retail space that had windows and door and the landlord <Music/Noise> wanted the space to be something else and I sent him a gift basket for his wife and a package with the letter about the brand to convince him that's my shop would be great in that location and because of my letter he decided that he was going to give me a shot and he wanted to meet with me to go over the terms so I'm sitting in this meeting feeling so victorious and convince this guy that you know my biz this is what he wants to put in here and he's so he says sell the terms are pretty basic I'm twenty four months deposit on the rent and other level and he's like talking and evenings and quickly adding in my head and I'm like That's fourteen thousand dollars Key that's fourteen thousand The yeah no clue what was going to get fourteen thousand dollars from and it worked out we had some small account set up for our sons for their college and we to get um you know might my boys were very <Music/Noise> you know we took <Music/Noise> between their two accounts I know something like thirty five hundred dollars out of the bank and then one of my on its loan me a little bit more like another four or five thousand dollars yet it worked out it was it was a little little dicey at first but it worked out and I paid my life back before Christmas of that here it's so incredible to hear how thirty five hundred dollars was just excruciating excruciating my money when of course in you know within a decade you were to be doing and tens of millions dollars in sales but at that time it was scary must've felt really scary it was definitely was the thing that that made it palatable was I knew I couldn't stay in the house like I know you're bursting at the seams and you can't accommodate people and your neighbors are starting to look at you like what's going on in there it is all these people that come in out every day we were actually watched at one point for suspicious activity because they're you know alleges ring in the ballon going inside they come out with bags like what school I'm in there and and and we found out later when you know the police officer came to shop and she teaches like I just wanna let you know because it probably didn't know this you owe somebody made a phone call and someone was nervous and eight you know realize that everything was okay and there was nothing untoward going on but yet you just get to a point where you you have to grow up in and you have to take that leap of faith and I didn't want to live in what if I had gotten the store my head what if I just I would rather have had the store fail than to have wondered what c'mon think about that story after story her her name was was in the marquee would she think when she walked in there she she she loved it but but i wld i will tell you the moment that she was like really excited about the business being Carol's Daughter I got to do the Oprah Winfrey Show in two thousand and two and so she got to see that you know to see her daughter on Oprah and all of her friends got to see that and the place where she went where she would get her blood work done on a regular basis was this Medical Center in Brooklyn called the hip Center where she was she sick yes with an illness called Polly my eyesight is so when she came to get her blood work done after that Oprah Winfrey Show all miss Carol was so happy to see you come right and Doctor So and so was waiting for you and then I'm going to take you down to the lab as soon as you're done she's edgy with it at this so fast I was you tell me he said Yeah girl keep going until I can get it hadn't had a Doe provided by you through the magazines and the attention you're getting there getting me on to the shell came through producers and the producers of the show heard about me from another producer who was interviewing for a job she went to Chicago to interview for a position they talked about what they were working on and one of the shows was a show about women who have started businesses in their homes and she said to them will have you spoken to Lisa Price and they reached out to be liked what they heard the interviewed me like six times a week later I was in Chicago taping the show and I was sitting in the audience and she looked at the screen she sees the name of the store and she said Carol's Daughter cows to know Carol's Daughter young camels I had an hour and I'm sitting here like only God knows me and I'm going to die the powder that affect business when oh when it was on Oprah it affected it in an amazing way we had our website go from having thirty seven people it is and within four minutes of my segment the audience in the website went from you know whatever it was thirty something people to seventeen thousand people wow the Web site actually crashed it was remarkable it was just remarkable not anything crazy like not what not what people think that you know one day you're on the show and all of a sudden you're a millionaire and money she's falling out of your hands not that but definitely a significant lift and shift in who knew about us but it was something that was manageable we didn't implode under the pressure so I mean basically folks from the moment you open that first or for the next at least decade you guys are just some of the massive growth trajectory which is like growing and growing and growing every year and opening more stores right what we did open additional stores for very long time I mean I I I wouldn't describe it as a massive growth trajectory there was growth each year but I wouldn't describe it as as massive I didn't open up another store until two thousand and five and in two thousand for I took on a business partner and then in two thousand five we took on investors any case had Simpson big deal and this is like Jay Z was an investor right yes Jay Z Will Smith Jada Pickett Smith and the investment helped us to open up the additional store but also helped us to get into places likes of four A at the time and then subsequently Macy's it helped to build a better infrastructure you know there's there's there's definite excitement and I know pri and everything when you're when you're small and your grassroots a new building but there comes a point you know when you start doing a million a million half to million to a half million in sales where you can wing it you know like things aft to be secure and and that's when investment was definitely needed because they"

I'd say woohoo you which may vary morale and we do sell hamburgers the the two this is the founder of Five Guys burgers and fries J Morrell is seventy three years old and it's been a long journey to get to where he is today he was born in the small mining town in northern Michigan and Jerry says when he was a kid his dad wasn't around that much she was a venture that he wasn't <Music/Noise> family oriented he was a stunt pilot that's probably why <Music/Noise> got a divorce <Music/Noise> went to Catholic <Music/Noise> a kid where <Music/Noise> not the best <Music/Noise> I didn't <Music/Noise> in fact <Music/Noise> some members <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> way Gerri good to get through school and <Music/Noise> to study at the University of Michigan I got scared but my god <Music/Noise> world all the smart people around the fact I was more intimidated after I got to college <Music/Noise> than ever the <Music/Noise> after college Cherry <Music/Noise> back to his hometown <Music/Noise> and he married <Music/Noise> girlfriend to get a job selling life insurance and <Music/Noise> that the marriage didn't last life and of leading <Music/Noise> the kids to Florida and for Jerry was a low point <Music/Noise> kind of floated around <Music/Noise> lived in different cities <Music/Noise> but he's good too with his life <Music/Noise> but he was sure <Music/Noise> thing well one thing washer of the caregiver kits <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> carry into the wide around the mid nineteen seventies Jerry was offered a consulting job in the DC area so he took it and he moved to Alexandria Virginia and that's where he met his second wife Janie and after situation stabilized a bit his kids did actually come to live with them and it was also around that time when Jerry decided to become a financial planner I was shocked at how much money there was in the DC area so some of the back of the financial planning Justin and I got my degree from Bryn Mawr and I started selling financial products to people in the DC area and that's why I didn't see the boys moved in with you all the sudden you've got five people have to fight people right and that was basically what you did you leave or financial planner Financial planner I tried a few businesses I started oil business and taxes so may I did a couple other dumb things I tried to start a water business of all things I thought somebody quarterback and we've been a good idea and they laughed at me and HER TIME IS money is in the early eighties I middle seventies the worst one was oil because I started a company and went down to Texas and found out that they were waiting for me because I was from the East winner take all my money and then when then my wife and I went to the real estate business and knew we were experts at the Bayan real high and then went to a crash and get rid of it so I get this right you were doing financial planning as your <Music/Noise> job that you had like all these business ideas you try it on the side and basically no more right I really didn't know what to do when I was lucky and is likely that that that that I got the hamburger visit the The The The The The The Five Guys be and what was and what adjustments I had a short sighted <Music/Noise> I well I grew up there was a guy name push him up told them we push them up that only had a little tiny hamburger place the ham he had a grill and he didn't so I think September and the ocean Papi the study about the people use the come from all over town to get hamburgers and then when I moved to Washington I saw some I just couldn't believe his Ocean City Maryland and a place <Music/Noise> boardwalk fries place or cost pressures that the spin twenty places so boardwalk fries only one place <Music/Noise> line pressures with one hundred feet long all day long for me and the kids got indoor <Music/Noise> hamburgers <Music/Noise> fries and keep it from the right word and that's <Music/Noise> came from the So what did you do did you did your wife and say Let's try Burger Joint yes which he said the same thing the banks of the time you guys your mind I we we did a little different we said Let's not put a lot of money into it unless find a place where the rent is real all either way nobody can see it and embrace a wide you want to do it that way and we said well if we can put it were it's hard to find but if we can get people come in there and we know we got something and this was in ninety six rate yes so where was the first location clearly apply and libro en Arlington Virginia and it was like a little place and rent was cheap in what was how much money just to put up today with our first or thirty five thousand dollars and wouldn't that cover everything the rent the equipment equipment we found junk equipment rebuilt it ourselves it was a stand up only and Shannon Matt were still in high school and was I think maybe thirteen or something and I said I got some money saved up for college if you want to go to college and um they pretty much said would rather do something else we could go back for second you set your kids down in you had your kid's college fund you said to them Hey look I got this college money I'll send you to college or you cannot go to college and use it to open a burger joint we you mean you can imagine today like a parent saying that to their kids and then other parents saying Your Mortgage in your kids' future on his burger joint yes did you have any of that feeling <Music/Noise> like maybe this is not great no no no I was telling us it was right thing to do probably look back and it was probably a soul was killed was kind of crazy it was crazy that didn't seem crazy to us is for some reason we all seem to be on board with it yet and that now I was really surprised because the kids jumped right in and work tired and Jamie worked on she kept all the books an I was amazed how the kids jumped into it in what is the story with a name had come up that was my lawyer said you should incorporate and you need to have a name as he fills up the papers this was so well thought out that we didn't have a name so me and Jamie and her voice and we had three sons plus one more son would Cheney my fifth son was born yet so his four sons and me so while all five guys for now and then we'll change it through the papers are over with change in colours ok joke <Music/Noise> is like your first day the Opening Day <Music/Noise> six did you get your salad the grand opening and not within the <Music/Noise> first open up that level of fire and the was no business on the recorder twelve <Music/Noise> and one person <Music/Noise> the the thirty where the <Music/Noise> land we made <Music/Noise> very first day we were breaking even <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> right because everybody was in when a couple employees but mostly was kits and we were paying <Music/Noise> time with them some fifteen hours how did you even <Music/Noise> make a burger I mean would you have good home chef was anybody or family good chef lists come from my hometown can't make a burger you can't will we know how to make burgers from where I'm from Posen was right near us and they raise potatoes I grew up in a farm <Music/Noise> to cook potatoes in a new Amber was born yet you knew how to grill a burger and fry potatoes and that's all you really <Music/Noise> that's <Music/Noise> the ingredients from like the potatoes and an analyst of like how did you know how to source the stuff we went to the Thrashers in Ocean City and looked in the potato bags and we found out they came from Rigby Idaho a guy named Rick Miles was small that a deal to actually get a hold of him and we said would you tell us that A is we did not know what the time that he was small now he's become a multimillionaire because we are potatoes from him I was so special about his potatoes they were sold by Thrashers and fifty for youth at eight if there's a line outside this potatoe joint the potatoes must be good be good what was five guys offering at that time was had burgers of all the toppings and all that stuff well we did with the kids Janie and I would not tell the kids how much we're a pain for the product we said whatever pickles you want to put on the hamburgers you guys picked pickles so they would try different brands and different pickles and they'd end up with the most expensive pickles were and we wouldn't say anything about it would say OK that's a pickle you want by those picked by Madison Park first okay then we will buy the most expensive cooking oil you want to cook in and it was pinned on her that's where they cook to Momo society they wanted to buy this bread from the little baker and an arm into it made really good bread brands bakery that had the best bakery in Arlington the time but for a rush of business at the expense and we're paying about seven times for a hamburger bun as McDonald's was and what was ever going for in nineteen eighty six I think were selling some flight three times four times a McDonald's with some for which your body so we are crazy would make it that way but we didn't let the kids know how much we're paying for any food so they would just go out there and whatever was left a like it that's way it was and was the thinking behind that strategy of thinking was that they're going to pick the best product they can pick what the customer likes what they like giving an example <Music/Noise> it is the kids liked a certain kind of mania because it was there with the whole thing together <Music/Noise> were buying <Music/Noise> time from guy up in New York <Music/Noise> hard to get along with and <Music/Noise> our first purchasing <Music/Noise> he should is no way that may need to support <Music/Noise> no way this guy was <Music/Noise> so we had all the family <Music/Noise> a blind <Music/Noise> eats to the end to this day I can be managed by itself <Music/Noise> like nine different dishes <Music/Noise> technical school and everybody would finish the maze blindfolded <Music/Noise> improve if you can't <Music/Noise> difference in this <Music/Noise> after the Abuja blindfold off my wife myself and all the boys picked the same <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the door <Music/Noise> game and <Music/Noise> it at the end of the month we look at the sales and then we look at how much we paid for the food in which a We got a razor price the kids to know why raise the prices but we would always say food costs and stay around thirty percent whatever we got to do to raise prices raise prices and which we have to worry about price we don't want to be in this business ok so you've got this first burger joint right and again had impaired people find out about people even know about the only way would be somebody else tell them they said there's this great burger places little like walk up shake it a try it that's the only way they would have found out about it there was a place in DC when I first moved to an office downtown at lunch or breakfast but was downstairs and was an alley and was not allowed or for member right to steel door come off the alley but all offices around there we go to this place and that was on Martin was an alley and was always impressed with the fact that that guy could do that much business of mine whom I knew much money was made to the soul that within three months it was gone the people were going there for the food was working and she was active back I can do that would just open up a corner and people like us felt calm if they don't like is they won't <Music/Noise> in the biz in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> five guys didn't stay <Music/Noise> and how they grew way beyond Virginia even though the last person who wanted to do that has cherry

Virginia the first people knew about it through word of mouth of course eventually newspaper started to write about the burgers and then the Lions started to get longer so Jerry and his family started to think about opening a second location that they needed the money to finance it but remember going in the bank and the do what I saw no food hamburger place that we just laughed at us but that summation Holmes said we got friends that their parents got a little bit of money and they know Five Guys is doing good maybe blast them for for a few thousand so we had eventually at about one hundred and fifty two hundred people that would be blowing any one time to give us money but not as investors just for loans we did a different way we did as investors would say five thousand hours will give you a certain percentage of the growths not never thought profit as it was always too many ways to get cheap people that way so I said will give a certain percentage of Gross will give you the money every single morning and anytime you want your money back you can have an air base about that stupid bigoted a blip was going to Mass for the money back but my method to my madness was also that I should do them any time and pay you back I came to someday have this thing was successful I will get better financing might go back to the people and pay him back into Milan and say you never gave them to they were equity owners Matt no real sense we just made a note said at the store does twenty thousand week you get certain percentage every week and we gave the money exactly on time every month so that we could always go back now for more money so how much money as you do raise for to do store number to offer store number two we probably only had a raise maybe a hundred and fifty thousand but we had we had a lot of people just want to throw money at a sale like the burgers are doing what they like the fact that we're making money and they're getting paid every month I had a bow seventy five people I didn't even know on that list and ISIS is everyone and don't put your money and somebody else's business and which is a lot of people saw some and five guys were you fully committed to this or did you leave no building financial plan on financing plan was and what point do you say to your kids your wife you know I'm going to give up my job and I'm going to focus on Five Guys full time well that was almost the day I got hit in the head with a broom I must have a bad day at the office of home and <Music/Noise> is that my wife I quit and she said You gotta Be Crazy Mom I'm dumb I'm going to work anymore I'm just going to concentrate on the burger business and she was pretty upset because she thought this is too risky yes and the U I think we can make this work well I just I thought it was fun guess I was still my kids I said You don't have to be in this business if you want to be make sure it's fun pics you like to do in the biz us the okay so now it was like the entire family focusing full time in five guys the what what great goals inevitably play well <Music/Noise> Cheney is like a general she is very <Music/Noise> runs off of <Music/Noise> my kids were able to go to investors <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> wasn't for them my <Music/Noise> all five guys I didn't go far to get the dishes sit <Music/Noise> this thing <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> believe that the <Music/Noise> ideas they pretend they <Music/Noise> so I have lived in the wash <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> know driving to Virginia in like nineteen ninety <Music/Noise> five guys <Music/Noise> when it was still just <Music/Noise> right locations two thousand to April two thousand to <Music/Noise> good to five jobs <Music/Noise> and were you doing pretty well <Music/Noise> making a decent living at that point because must enrich know you were but the <Music/Noise> is we had figured out the nuts and bolts of the most franchise years start off the franchise we didn't start off the franchise we had no idea we're going to do that we started off to build a family business and we put seventeen years into it when we figured out how to do it right yet so it came time to franchise him and we had a perfect system had you been at that point say you hate lets franchise let's build this thing out of my sons came to me about the nineteen late in the late nineteen ninety and started trying to convince me that franchise and I was dead set against it really dead set against it because I didn't think there's any way I could convince other people to do or don't have the change of mind well there was a guy named Mark Moseley was selling franchises for another company he been watching Five Guys for wow and my kids got me to meet with them I don't want to do it in fact they bought me a book called franchise in for Dummies it was written by Dave Thomas oh they get from Wendy's yes okay so <Music/Noise> that and I the legal stuff it was amazing all the rules how to fall in everything arm so when they talk me into it why didn't she want to do it because if or when you start franchising first of all time franchise either not to worry about food costs are pretty pretty stupid unit on franchisee that you're not going to advertise ourselves pretty stupid even Tommy only going to sew hamburgers and french fries it's all going to say when we got to be open later we get to sell alcohol only got to watch food cos we gotta shop around for our products and don't do that night and I get by we buy from people who will stick with them that was all hard to sell to franchisees but we got through that and I remember Mark Kamen he was going to our salesman we he should show a camera Amish stores the first year the shelf in the butt I should not discuss that and the South fifteen to twenty five and I think within that <Music/Noise> of the two years we sold thirty five hundred the show <Music/Noise> States The Who The awakening your burgers were still a lot <Music/Noise> expensive <Music/Noise> for absolutely <Music/Noise> took a lot lot lot longer to get a burger that really cute at least it's not snow takes longer to get a burger so the business model is different so are you worried Egypt or think maybe this works another Virginia but I'm not sure this is going to work somewhere else absolutely scared the heck out of us were talking about the long wait the staff assigned the first orders that said if you're in a hurry there are a lot of really good burger places near here Omar can put that out and help yeah I remember the first franchise store we opened up was in Richmond oh my god Richmond nobody you know we are in Richmond I couldn't sleep the night before Richmond that slide down the road ninety miles it's not often but I couldn't even sleep nobody's going <Music/Noise> rich miss toh was successful and then they said was never going to go to North Carolina and South to know when those who have known there was no way we're going to Florida because people never buy that product in Florida to their older people and Florida to get a hundred stores in Florida shown me the idea of going from five stores in two thousand to two thousands of stores within a year to year we didn't go to thousands of stores which sold franchises those are still being built out in the United States we've got about fourteen honor of them built our now with all the territory the United States is gone was that just mind boggling mind boggling mind going and I was I was so proud of my kids that didn't go to their head they're still my kids they work just like the use of a work hard every day what does it mean what's it like to work with your five sons and in your life I mean they're all involved to come and what did each do a different thing for the company while I have one son that just loves doing stuff in the stores like make sure the paint dry and decorated dry and he's really into that so that's his job that's what he does mostly the ones a fanatic about the food and so he goes around the world put nine shows them how to cook things right stuff and another son that he's really into the financing part of the graph that mean I'm glad because I'm <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> spaces international fine everybody's kind of found their <Music/Noise> we grandkids four grandkids work in the business <Music/Noise> some I teach him some <Music/Noise> filled in one of them she loves taking care of making sure there's no food or new shoes <Music/Noise> she <Music/Noise> and I don't find what they want to find and capture can be filled by them to hire somebody is your family still the primary owner of the company yes we own about seventy five percent are coming to my family but we took in a fairly big investor first our franchise and they don't interfere in our business at all they gave us a big chunk of money from their entrepreneurs to and they saw someone find guys what percentage of the actual restaurants team has owned as a design window of a of about fourteen fifteen hundred restaurants we have a joint venture in Great Britain and France and Germany <Music/Noise> with our partner half that about sixty stores and then over here we own about four hundred and fifty of the fourteen hundred Hemi country's total is five days in now where in Great Britain which I guess it's the one country for now the UK and now we've got sixty stores there were two in France we just opened up and downs that was a storm Madrid we got several stores in the Middle East and so I think a lot of people in the little bit successful they look back and trying to figure out how they did it I can't figure out though <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> it was like bah my God yeah <Music/Noise> two things a lot of credit <Music/Noise> a great believer in <Music/Noise> intuition <Music/Noise> or a Higher <Music/Noise> God or whatever you wanna call it a great believer in listening to my hunch is <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> I could of <Music/Noise> for sure my kids I am lucky and got my kids my wife does this seems to me without them nothing <Music/Noise> but the We were lucky though again real real long do you really are vision <Music/Noise> to open up a burger joint vision was to get kids to live with you <Music/Noise> life divorced which that was here I guess that was a real success getting your kids things <Music/Noise> yeah the best <Music/Noise> my light kit <Music/Noise> the best thing that's happened to her mother which is my ex wife is the fact that they're able to do all kinds of wonderful things for ya oh and you still have a relationship with her well my my current wife we know she's benefited from me or the success of your sons to do how did being financially stable and set had to change a life or be able to do things that you couldn't do before well most people than I know I've known since about a kid when I started five guys I let three or four my buddies and went to highschool with buys stock in my company because I thought it would be a great thing for them they didn't have money little bit low but the moment it much and one of my loan the money"

the the the grown so fast we had TV go in we have started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of stuff and we wear and the middle of that when <Music/Noise> happened and of course people stopped traveling and travel guides and just stopped did you think that there was a possibility that the whole thing would collapse yes we did have to let people go we did have to remember books we did and I honestly <Music/Noise> that <Music/Noise> to disappear <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the the yard it's how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists <Music/Noise> behind the movements they built <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> had Tony <Music/Noise> backpack the long Asia hippie trail <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> jotted down some notes and turn them into the travel guide company in the world so much of how a company comes together happens Nigel hands the Baton of Sir J Brennan Larry Page never met and would there be Google if Kate and Andy spade and never work in the same clothing store in Tucson Arizona and would the Kate spade bags had been the same thing for every envy or Instagram where B Parker they all have and because of a chance meeting just a moment in time that could have passed which is the story of lonely Planet guidebooks because it all started on a bench in regions Park in London over afternoon in nineteen seventy Maureen Wheeler was just looking for a quiet place to sit and read I was walking around the park that was only one vests that had some and I will try several times because among the banks is also young man I thought if I sit not when she's trying to pick me up and I really don't feel like that so I woke up few times and I thought dammit this is nineteen seventy I consider <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> a sunny bench and turned my back to the young man and started reading my book we didn't know it it's appalling <Music/Noise> comic is a <Music/Noise> of it and I was just reading that when this <Music/Noise> came on set and started reading Tolstoy the twenty two <Music/Noise> I said Is this the in place to read on a Thursday afternoon and she replied to your reply positively I turned around looked at him as of right to say get lost and and and he's got nice eyes and I liked him so I said I don't know I haven't been here that long we started chatting and after a while Tony Astoria if she wanted to see a movie so they went and I'm on the way home we got lost and we wandered around for quite awhile for I realize these laws because honey just said softly confidently and keeps going thinking he's going off the right direction and the thing is that's been our entire lives together anyway that first eight led to a second and then into a third and then twelve months the day later we got married and Chinese proposal was very very safely was it was Mei Mei and he said I would have no new <Music/Noise> on October the seventh and he says you get married and I said you don't get married because you've known each other for a year and she said no but we would save tax I know I was a business school so that's my excuse for that I'm afraid it was in the most romantic so when she got married did would you think you just get jobs in London <Music/Noise> lives that was pretty much the plan <Music/Noise> we met just the start of my two year course <Music/Noise> and we got <Music/Noise> through that <Music/Noise> the son sometime in that second year together we decided we were going to take a year off and traveling <Music/Noise> certainly changed things how did you guys make that decision what was the conversation yet I don't know if I was very much a thing to do that here I mean later on they started calling it the hippie trail we just called it the Asia Overland trip that you you left London <Music/Noise> east but this was the airing of the music of the time was writing the Marrakech Express from the Beatles are often in <Music/Noise> of sort of cultural significance to it but we joined what became known as the hippie trial <Music/Noise> headed east so this is I guess around nineteen seventy two ish and what was the plan the plan was to drive from London to wherever to wherever I feel that the county for this card it was so cheap that we thought what if it breaks down will get out of it only by the road we were going to go as far east as we could go head to dispose it would break down with selling one of the other social us set out anyone like me to start writing to Europe and then and just keep driving it is he going to the ego at the border with check in around the new Red Cross around you go right across church at Afghanistan and then we just keep things in Pakistan and UK through India <Music/Noise> you couldn't get across had to fly across Burma and then we just carry on the plan <Music/Noise> to get to Australia and then we would stay in Australia and work for a while and would save up enough money and would fly back to London <Music/Noise> the plan we had so little money we left London with four hundred pounds so that was our money and you just stayed like slept in the van we did at times but generally we camped most the time across Asia into a gritty achieve in Afghanistan in Afghanistan <Music/Noise> hotels in those days that being gardens and you could camp in the garden at that time why did you even <Music/Noise> where to go and what to do and how to get the right bus I mean haven't you figure all that stuff out it's not that hard I mean if you look in da bus station in Afghanistan and a kind of pointing towards the border somebody will put you on the right bus you know <Music/Noise> if you're wondering <Music/Noise> with the bag <Music/Noise> looking to know that he would like to look <Music/Noise> will point you towards a hotel you'll see something that looks like a hotel you know you're in a restaurant you will for the ads it's not it's easy easy today because you just <Music/Noise> but I'm talking nineteen seventy till right at me there was <Music/Noise> really ever <Music/Noise> and actually you know what what was great is that you could travel for weeks without saying another Weston but then suddenly a pile and some are like Kabul <Music/Noise> to our hair up and the others and you just spent the afternoon just trading information in it when you get here this place is good this place isn't useful information that way this is like old fashioned communication and what I call all along you are keeping a journal Tony are both you guys are I did keep a diary <Music/Noise> being reason to be deciduous about documenting things and keeping records of things but what you write down all just where we stayed <Music/Noise> cost and how many miles the car that day and now I think about the palace <Music/Noise> in the fortress is you know those things are just as important but those days it was very much the information <Music/Noise> which costs could think that's what we were later <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and presumably particular to know this is like next to no <Music/Noise> yet know we had to do everything as cheaply as possible so it was our class rail and it was hitchhiking we hitch hike from Bangkok all away to Singapore to get down that the women to cross by boat to Jakarta and then we went by bus to Bali and Bali were really run out of luck the island that was supposed to though theirs was to have tickets on to take is to stray a broke down and didn't have any war planes and sew them we met this new Zealander had lately often he was looking for crew to get down to Australia so Lou we got on his yacht Anchorage a strata was at like scary at all anytime I think I got really <Music/Noise> huge storm in the boat and if I'd had more sensitive than terrified but they're so busy hanging onto the boat and then the thinking goes astray <Music/Noise> standing on the OT looking at this coastline and nothing on it nothing at all would come in and places miles from anywhere and there was nothing I have another snakes or spiders in all kind of Gee <Music/Noise> what I'm doing here what did you think you would do that you think he would hang out there for awhile because neither of you had any connections in Australia right now we went to Sydney Festival in Michigan to go to Australia Sydney is the golden city that you will head towards the yellow brick road leads that after crossing the bridge on our last ride and I said and it was not long after Christmas so it was quite close to holidays I said to Tony how much money have we got left and the Buddha's Hands document he said he got twenty seven cents bicycle how the English may not much so what did you do like how did you even had a camera so <Music/Noise> went to the area of Sydney way you dispose of the sort of things alone shop and we got twenty five dollars for my camera which I bought back a week later than twenty five dollars and in those days you get a room for a week for fifteen dollars <Music/Noise> we <Music/Noise> with a single bad guy that is those day than a communal kitchen and bathroom newlyweds you know from and take the stage we were married <Music/Noise> two years now with your dad felt like we'd known eachother for two years I got a job again that afternoon instantly and the little kind of corner shop but they did sandwiches and things and the end of the day let me take some of his home that were left so we ate and I worked there for awhile until Lee and Amy posts you know got good jobs one year trip and now become a three year trip so what did you what kind of judging attorney I got of marketing job for a pharmaceutical company Maureen you're working a job another was debuting city as a P A <Music/Noise> company you're working for a wine company how do you get to a point where you're you start selling a travel book well the heat was all the great ideas like it's from around the world and lets the guidebooks I mean I was Satan is the architect and the Carpenter C said look we should do a book on the radio that this was after we met so many people every time we went to some sort of party all met friends at restaurants and so on always someone would ask us Where did you go <Music/Noise> this there was a lot of interest in the sort of trip we did after awhile we thought hey we could just telling <Music/Noise> things down and will actually make the information down in the form of a Balkan summit and I I was working said in an office was able to get my typewriter and bring <Music/Noise> and from a bar of the guillotine when we were dreaming all the books and one of those masses papers stapled together so anyway <Music/Noise> kind of the Jews were able to get enough equipment to do this we had it printed but it was Sam is a very basic that it was a very it was actually done <Music/Noise> was done in our kitchen table the collection really had a kitchen kitchen a bedroom so and then you take it to a printer and you ran off copies of it we found the little that we didn't get a big commercial printer was a tie at this point <Music/Noise> the basement <Music/Noise> and he printed them for us but we just part of the pages we actually voted them put them together is Maureen says stapled them and trimmed the edges the guillotine a hernia home produced book but one that they were finished and although we had them in boxes at our apartment I took a day off work and I went straight to the bookshop that said buy fifty copies of it and said Okay here I am right medio de vino at the end of the day I'd sold a surprising <Music/Noise> what was a price or eighty calorie So for those ninety six pages that sold for one dollar eighty and the cover all the countries you went through full of all <Music/Noise> six very brief but I went in to what we got her big break as Ava's I went into a bookshop and she said message wanna buy this book and he said so accompany us and I said Loney patches that have never heard of them and I said no you wouldn't and I showed her the book in time she saw what your telephone number in case I want to get the book so we didn't have a telephone in hand so I had given my work number and she called me and she said um my flatmate is a journalist and she wants to interview you and your husband on TV so we went on television talk about our trip and in this book and that was our first big publicity things and yet I was out I was reading to your first guide with a pan flat and it's in there there's some pretty different things in there I like Amy McGee tells you where you can find marijuana <Music/Noise> hard to find where to get a fake ID and stuff like that right I think I still think student cards they were very popular still on some places I have to assume that you you know you guys could not have been like stoned hippies because you're motivated to write everyday and to go places and to cattle are actually really boring we didn't do a lot of that stuff will occasionally but very rarely in fact it was years later I was lonely planet became better known all these people who are using on the planet you know and what they were really cool people in school people used on the planet and Tony and I would be at the cafe and all the cool people but we just didn't look old and yet we were the ones for the work yet so it sit there quietly while the holding of the cooler and doesn't think ugh ugh this is interesting and had you come up with with with the name lonely Planet I know there's a story behind that we got the book ton of headway at everything that a title for it is across Asia on the cheek we didn't have a title for the publishing <Music/Noise> for the publishing house and we've been at a restaurant and thinking too much red wine and we just been to <Music/Noise> rock'n'roll band on the road film Mad Dogs and Englishman whose Joe Cocker and Leon Russell traveling around <Music/Noise> in the late sixties Trek film one <Music/Noise> that that that movie and that Ms Joe Cocker singing a song called Space Captain and the first line of the song goes once while traveling across the sky this lonely Planet caught my eye on the <Music/Noise> the the the <Music/Noise> most it to Moreno was humming the song has such nice weather we call the company lonely Planet sphere to which Maureen said actually the first lines lovely play and I wish he would stop singing and an esa Colonia kind it's even better is that how we said well just sense the SOS ok it's a great day and is a great song for us is one unit <Music/Noise> to live together on this planet is going <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> so do the first book of like make any money not much that has not started covering the cost of the print I didn't lose money on it but it wasn't a real money making proposition but around that time and we were thinking of the Okay this is when we quit and head back to Europe then we began to think that has sold surprisingly <Music/Noise> maybe we should do another book and what we thought was towards the end of the trip from London with cum dancer Southeast Asia because of that time the Vietnam War was still winding <Music/Noise> so Southeast Asia wasn't seen as a hotspot for a holiday it was a was a place next to was an but we could see that was about to change we thought okay well do as we travel around South East Asia and will write the best book anybody's ever seen in Southeast Asia we had a Yamaha trail bike that was our transport and at this point Tony did you think this is I think this is what we're going to do no I still think you know we we realize we sort of found a sweet spot we found we were doing something that people really liked but you know one of the things I've said a lot <Music/Noise> it was like Yo dot com or via social media set up these days they start on <Music/Noise> and week later they're worth a billion dollars that was not subtle we did our business grew very <Music/Noise> and I think it was it was more like a snowball rolling <Music/Noise> gotta keep pushing it at first and then it starts to develop momentum starts to get larger as it broke down the hill the the the <Music/Noise> land we come back as Tony <Music/Noise> grew lonely Planet and then shrink it and then <Music/Noise> almost lost it and I rise here listening to how I built this from

the the the <Music/Noise> welcome back to high buildings from NPR guy Russ and so in nineteen seventy three Tony <Music/Noise> were traveling around Southeast Asia once again and they were doing research for their second lonely Planet book <Music/Noise> but it was just about finished I had a dummy of the book there was one big book shop in Singapore I got a appointment with the buyer for that book shop I thought to myself you know he'll definitely certain buy ten copies and if I'm lucky like twenty or fifty you listen to my spiel denied my tummy of the book I saw him riding Southeast Asia on a shoestring and me on the order form and invite some numb but at least on the <Music/Noise> did push across the destiny of thousand copies I know I walked out of that that office a foot above the ground and re spec to the hotel and its mores which sold twenty percent of opera and one bookshop fantastic Chafee saw the success of that but what I mean what was your next move we did another one to one another when people started coming to us with ideas for other books and Maureen did you think I mean Sosa by the mid seventies or late seventies Eve and did you still did you think that this was going to be your work I mean did you did you both kind of focus fulltime on this thing now pretty much although I was at university that I have plenty of time after the first year the only planet in the Nob and you are a full time job <Music/Noise> you more in <Music/Noise> worked on the books I didn't think it was going to be our life I couldn't say how could it was still Tony and I living in a little rented house with a pile of boxes boxes everywhere full of books and when we know we wrap them with address them and put them in the back of the car and taken to the post office I mean you don't really see a multinational conglomerate I did this and I was still going down to the docks to pick the books up when they came in from the printer and then sending them out again you know it still felt like very much like a cottage industry you know and it was like un raised any money or just give us any money basically if you told a bank and what we're doing books on that say Get a Life wasn't really why we didn't have any money and the work making a lot of money but we're making enough to keep on doing books but we did find other people were coming to us today used the book and say You know I've really liked your book traveling around Southeast Asia I've been living in South America you know I could write a book about this place of the place so we we started getting other people coming to us with similar <Music/Noise> and really by the end <Music/Noise> get about twenty books yet but with a turning point what was the book that like all the sudden where you thought OK this is our breakthrough lot of good it was very <Music/Noise> the balloons and we did a book on India we researched out in <Music/Noise> eighty this was the first time we've been able to put a team into a place of more <Music/Noise> email me at two other riders we divided the country up north to south the middle and I found out I was pregnant just the week before I flew to India for this five month trek around India House you're pregnant traveling in India and would just like that like stuffing pamphlets and brochures and notes into backpacks yes very much say anything else something that we also collect every brochure every time table every math I mainly go was hardly anything in Iraq sex and come back with his massive pile of information of stuff yet much easier these days we put all my memory stick and suddenly we had this book that was over seven hundred pages and it sold for double figures as twelve dollars or fourteen dollars or something instead of three or four and it just sold its always the one hundred thousand copies of how it was the first All India book of that kind of guy that told you everything and there but it wasn't a book like that but that was all of the huge interest in India at the time you know so it just took right off the company doubled in size overnight and we suddenly started taking on more riders and looking at other big projects and and you had a baby at this point yes I said What did you do have a juicer we took away the sewing when she was held this time she went to India to India to Malaysia and she was eight months yet so we dragged our eight month old daughter ran with us I have two children and every school holiday with witches go Africa or Asia or wherever and a travel with us for that period of time every time we got a chance we'd go and try was a family but mainly when he was doing the writing and this was the timing and all that and I was doing the carpentry and keeping it together yet how it actually moved out of the House met a real office moved into a kind of ramshackle office we had a lot of kind of lose contractors and flowed in amount of inflow data can and we pay them by the outsourcing so it was beginning to take shape in the eighties as a real business when what point did you stop having sleepless nights about whether you are going to be sustainable I know I had sleeve had sleepless nights all every year I would say actually towards late eighties early nineties I think was more when it became obvious at this thing has its own momentum and it was carrying us as much as we were pushing it and I've talked to people who are doing the hand in the publishing LP at that time and they said it just seemed like we couldn't do anything wrong that every book we did you know <Music/Noise> and I think we studied in Europe guys because we were this little publisher or the other end of the world who'd started off doing Asia how many finally did get around to doing Europe we were big enough by that point we could really do it well and I think people in the office really got a kick out of that that it was such a thrill doing that and sort of you know going out and taking on anybody in the world wanted to try and compete with us I mean people everywhere you went for using any kind of guides to give me a thrill you know in a New York seeing someone come in with the German copy of Chinese copy or you know whatever adjust I used to love that the But when the whether every moments where it wasn't going well room of the was a period when things were not looking very good and I have a knitter and two thousand and eight he had grown so fast and reached a point were doing so much we had TV going we have started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of staff a lot of you know we've created a whole lot of desktop publishing before it was even a term of a lot of money that books are still selling like crazy that we were just doing so much and we wear and the middle of that when nine eleven happened and of course people stopped traveling and travel guides and just stop did you think that there was a possibility that the whole thing with class yes I I definitely like I did not know the reasoning for the optimist I mean and that's one of his charms but it's also one of the most infuriating things because we were definitely looking and had a really bad time with her looking at we did have to let people go out we did have to cut back on our offices overseas we did have to compact the number of books we did and it was looking I honestly didn't believe that that was possible the whole thing to say in retrospect I think Maureen few of us much more accurate than mine we really had to pull start putting everything together and we did cut back and make it a much more efficient business owner to turn around it a couple years to turn round I guess it was around and around that time I guess in the mid two thousand <Music/Noise> you wound up selling the company right yes I think we both felt that it wasn't the same company anymore it was it was turning into much more of a digital company and that has a way of taking over everything it's not something I'm particularly excited about we we really felt it was time not and it was new to be a dentist who work in hand onto our kids the kids are both worked in the company at one stage but neither of them are going to take over from us and we just had to feel it was time to move on to something else and I mean can't you feel great"

efficiency in cars Coke employees accept and tackle life's big challenges head on see how a K O C H challenge dot com then <Music/Noise> we made <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I was sick about <Music/Noise> in fifty years of great <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> stuff and <Music/Noise> judgment <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> but <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> from NPR it's how I felt the show the innovators <Music/Noise> feel it's <Music/Noise> behind the movement <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> in on Today Show Young <Music/Noise> sex drugs and rock'n'roll packaged <Music/Noise> most iconic magazines <Music/Noise> and built a publishing empire <Music/Noise> the scene you probably notice about the people who get on the show is the All Sun opportunity and they took it sure that was locked it was hard work failure persistence all that but the difference between say a Sara Blakely hand the rest of us is that in the nineteen nineties she saw an opportunity to improve women's undergarments and she sees did ride canyons on opening to make better personal computers in the nineteen eighty so he built compact and for yon where he was also in the right place at the right time in the nineteen sixties he was a student journalist at UC Berkeley right at the time <Music/Noise> is going to bury our becoming the center of youth culture in America <Music/Noise> but just being there wasn't enough what John Leonard did was to capture the moment to take that energy and create a gathering place for Young People magazine that spoke to them in their language terms of the small small town yet not all a little off to be me get the <Music/Noise> time is that beautiful picturesque town which was very tolerant of social behavior that was a little off the center and the arts community service of proceeding Iraq mall scene and hippies especially with the bead gem air Falcons bring Karo act of throwing Getty and they all found a home and seven Cisco as the people like Lenny Bruce so it had a thriving beat NEC alternative lifestyle community and so therefore was extremely tolerant of the rock'n'roll groups are springing up where even weirder than the BX and coffeehouse scene as consistent Sam's long history of being tolerant of all kinds of political movements artistically it's interesting because a question live a pretty strong students at Columbia and in Boston that Miss M Jusco Berkeley that was the center of of student activism in America arguably in the world at the time I think so yeah I'm a clumsy came several years after nineteen sixty eight so I think I really started this as the Bay Area was coming by very early days of civil rights homes or losses were going off on marches down south and artists manos kind of thing so I think Levi has them among students really was generated in excess of the Bay Area was an exciting exciting time oh yeah I mean because you know the full commitment and passion sense of possibility in the postwar baby boom just trying to come of age son become college students and sensing that day it was their turn on stage as their right or responsibility to try and make America stand up for deeper and behave in such a way as they were we were taught in school America's ideals were about every life every pursuit of happiness to me in how you met Ralph Gleason because he would of course a figure very prominently in the founding story of Toby who was he and Adam Moore Ralph Gleason was a jazz columnist for the services of Chronicle edition coverage as he would buy about some rocker moldings Dylan Beatles Stones and he was on the few voices around anymore to come GL and seven Cisco that the saying Hey there's real merit to these artist Adele and deals Monday doing is important is important as culture in point so as a rock roll fan I'd read that has three times a week column so he was somebody you pay close attention and I met him at a rock roll show and Sam Sisk I think once the militia was called a tribute to Doctor Strange and you just went to him and said Hey M Young winner yes I did many said I know you I've been reading your column it's funny how blown away that this famous <Music/Noise> was I sure wasn't because I can pardon all my column after so we chatted slacked and then suddenly a medic of more times we had lunch some like data caps each other dance and became buddies <Music/Noise> also I got since I was his take me under his wing <Music/Noise> he likewise doing coz price can to ensure the company how much older was he that you <Music/Noise> I was probably twenty of the time he's forty so he's an adult you are and at what point did you say to him hate loudest or magazine together which the store had a very even and the conversation begin well he kind of looked after my career I admit I was after in the summer of sixty five I was in London living there as wild eyed kid I came back the state is looking for jobs and we knew of anything and he said he did there was something available think something ramparts magazine and stepsister when <Music/Noise> up <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> ramparts Magazine <Music/Noise> very left wing kind <Music/Noise> journalism magazine as in charge of that tender age of the arts entertainment comfort which doesn't charge me heavily towards rock'n'roll hippie culture so can sae much of the stuff that would end up in rollers don't have an after that job ran out about nine months later I was kind of loss what to do I was twenty years old at time of twenty one and no career training <Music/Noise> job prospects this is digital digital back to Ralph for help well we're very we're big fans as I was looking to Ralph for career advice and guidance or something to do with him since we're so it's a paddock and sank about who he saw the world and we tried a couple of different ideas he added The Book Book two anthology something center around music and I guess he either here I said Why don't we start a publication about and I was a high bar to get or below barman was a Canadian newspaper on newsprint sewing me a full scale magazine launch and was going to be focused on rock'n'roll on Raw was or anything like that in nineteen sixty seven nothing like that so help me understand this and this guy roughly sand a notable well respected jazz critic this have to chronicle young man the middle aged has enough confidence in a twenty one year old kid to say yes to start a rock and roll magazine with you and it does sound implausible now doesn't it the I don't know I mean we got along really well and we share the same vision and he had when he was young star publication called Jazz quarterly which was so mean some of the same fans magazine about that match as so I think he probably saw in me <Music/Noise> version of himself how he saw the possibilities he saw that I had some high level of talent ambition it might be able to bring something off he even gave me money for what was the ambition did you guess it and say we're going to make the base magazine in America I know I mean I don't know if we knew it because Maisie in America was but that was by the ambition ambition was to do something that was new and fresh about music and whatnot was <Music/Noise> dance time to start to have some very serious little content and social economy these were people start to articulate a <Music/Noise> rebellious stance toward society they were <Music/Noise> concerned about is writing a lot about alienation <Music/Noise> a good deal for writing a lot about social mores and how people should be treated this way things are beginning to resonate deeply with a new young generation which I was on the <Music/Noise> of the Ralph says OK let's let's do this he has a little cash to put and yet some cash but then I cut from the <Music/Noise> two thousand my mother <Music/Noise> other a lot to be <Music/Noise> some money from a college friend <Music/Noise> and also for my step and that the assembled together was seventy five hundred dollars <Music/Noise> of the the <Music/Noise> who and what I mean what did you do from that point did you assemble a staff did you start to write articles that you've to find a place that was going to print is big because he's starting today you could spur on line but then finding a printer and that's expensive it's an expensive proposition might distribute well yeah I was all calm and not too expensive but we need to find offices so we went in the printer that we had used it Sunday ramparts agreed to give us offices upstairs playing facility since we're going to print the magazine that we assembled friends of mine people I met ramparts of people in Berkeley or other people write about the rock will see the small to volunteer their efforts write articles and take pictures or put it together so it was really a volunteer effort and as you come up with the name on the rattle of names the one that kept sticking with Rolling Stone that don't song Like a Rolling Stone and tile an essay that Ralph had written for a small publication called The American scholar she laid out his thinking about the meaning of rock on what's important and <Music/Noise> developing American society and just walk me through this in nineteen sixty seven I mean because today of course there's lawyers in their zealous seasons and documents of incorporation and there's equity splits did you have to do any of that was just fly by the sheep at the pharmacy the pants mean nothing about magazine publishing and distribution out of a gun or saying what editorial wasn't much of the like and you had a right or experience at the record companies and it was just the right out in December the the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the I mean you are creating business did you had you even <Music/Noise> where to start I had no not you know we just we pay we could pay for the Miley had a man that would be as far as ego and says We're paying salaries or paying rent are only cos really was printing the paper and the cost of decisions which I was even aware of until two or three months later and all these fucking bills kept coming yeah oh my god so from the time that you raise that seventy five hundred dollars to the time the first issue came out was how long will it take about three months two months that's fast fast are Peter and and so what was that to me but the first issue was when John was on the cover photo of him as private between <Music/Noise> How I won the war and neck and actually I'm not that we send out somebody take <Music/Noise> but just whatever free publicity photographs were flying <Music/Noise> we're looking for something and there was a package of of the pictures that Moose is coming a mistake that John and trust that <Music/Noise> intended to be brilliant when looking back at the choice of John <Music/Noise> our first issue is more than <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> reviews <Music/Noise> and seven Cisco was there the colors chosen the big thing must be the day investigation into what <Music/Noise> to them I have been hard at the Monterey <Music/Noise> been given to charity or not that long for <Music/Noise> kind of stepped right into a traditional job <Music/Noise> so tell me about just getting the articles in the deadlines we would eat with your new riders going out and and making deadlines and are you working round the clock to get this thing out was it a weekly monthly as every other movie had very few writers as very hard to push them to heart all volunteer not paying anybody to ask him things but everyone is like in view the same spirit enthusiasm for and people really pitched in and and and we are able to get that thing out every two weeks without fail from then on how silly you despite the fact the you are in this are the center of the sex drugs rock'n'roll culture you cat couldn't really take part in it too much because you have to run a magazine you are to publish that Banksy were all how can I ask that question you could do both but you really one has to sacrifice for the other I mean once it gets going and as you try impressing me every two weeks you really have no time to think of anything but the next day more copy more stories and all the little things that go into a mouse the mail room is healthier and how did you fund it did you have to also put of course adds I'm assuming right well we're trying to sell as we get a few ads here in entertainment there was not much revenue they might get five hundred dollars an issue in advertising at the beginning so how much runway did you have with that seven hundred dollars was funny because as that would go out the means to gain some eyes in from selling it at newsstands in the BB checks from that some advertisers and people might start striving paying five dollars We are sorry that so you know there's enough to keep it going that sooner or later we hired our first employee got to see twenty five dollars a week and by the end of the first year we were a viable business with three or four people being paid getting at regularly sung thirty or forty thousand copies an issue people were responding to the back comes to liking we're getting letters and correspondence and recognition from various artists in the first year we bought a long interview with Pete Townsend Jagger so it was making gather momentum people liked what they saw the DQ have that advantage because you were the only magazine <Music/Noise> there well yes nobody else is trying to do this I mean the primary mainstream press didn't <Music/Noise> care at all about this particular corner of American culture or give much credence or thought the idea there's a kind a booming new generation about over the baby was going to have a big impact in that time still useable looked down upon as teenage <Music/Noise> ephemeral disabled people really strange <Music/Noise> long hair cannot <Music/Noise> accept all people but unless the music was the kind of tribal Telegraph the drums are beating for young people around the world can communicate with each other to other people like them around <Music/Noise> so this is the way young people communicate there was nothing else <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> said You remember what worked when the magazine started to get attention was it a year to three like one one to study becomes and people just talk about when the first time the goal of tensions on the first year anniversary we printed the cover the band two versions cover the alma John Yoko John Bonner did get the one that shot them and back sides and then act picture of them and completely naked so we ran as our first anniversary issue am a guy article about ourselves in a sense of the first press which was telling his New Deal perils SF but we had we sold out the printing the print more than just Kai got more more people talking and then I think in her too big especially young groupies that cause more tension with the photo for him before about girls of all bands around <Music/Noise> associated bad that I think led to an article in Time magazine about us so we're starting to get a little on the national <Music/Noise> you know sales are picking up the big cities around the sky spreads by word of mouth and then find me a deal with more of a national magazine wholesaler threaten a company's Francisco and start appearing more more run the country the more we hear the more like a more subscriptions came and more babies came in so we felt we really had a going business you know after the first year we had a question about survival committed <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> crush her counsel because it's fair to say he was your first really big breakthrough writer I add new hunters work before spiraling stone earring a book called The Hells Angel on and so I just wrote a letter after this I really don't ask him to write something for us and he wrote back saying geez he didn't really want reading was stone is terrific and great but he loved to write but he couldn't lie now because he was busy involved in running for sheriff of Aspen Colorado so I wrote an actual wanted to write about that and which she did and which we publish couple months later was called the Battle of Aspen or free power in the Rockies and of course the idea the running for sheriff of Aspen caught norms and attention in media place around the world of sudden he was inundated with reporters and film crews from New York from London suffer like that that was once again is just our reputation growing more more so in nineteen seventy two I mean at what I mean I'm I was a huge fan of her Thompson's work and when I was special and I was younger and I mean you have signed this guy to cover the nineteen seventy two McGovern campaign a serious presidential campaign was any part of you like me this is all risky this guys you know the sky the use of drugs in these a little bit nuts and maybe the maybe I think that's what it took me by that time hundreds and a couple of serious deep investigative pieces for us on the geese Elena check on the road there he had we done feeling off Vegas and he had become our star writer star reporter saw was always on look after will be the next great thing for Ana to do here so the election comes along in the first time they hills or franchise to vote is in any war situation is those antiwar election and Hunter had this camp low back or having one for Sharon mean very mean actually covered Nixon years before so it was just kind of a natural thing I mean American politics why not send out an expert on Hell's Angels to do American politics made for sense the <Music/Noise> just a moment why Rolling Stones ditch San Francisco for New York and how it became the most influential music magazine <Music/Noise> in the world stay with us listening to how I built this from NPR <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise>

Huffington Post and also listen for details about life events later in the summer coming to San Francisco and Seattle we would love to see you there and get a chance to me for details on how to buy a ticket you can go to NPR presents dot o RG the the Halo combat to hide this from NPR and Kai rise till it's the early nineteen seventies and Rolling Stone is trying to get a lot of national attention at this point is operating out of a brand new office in a magazine even starts to publish in color they just decide Hunter S Thompson the brilliant acid dropping Gonzo journalist cover the nineteen seventy two presidential election nothing says you get gas and power that may be even better than that that was that was a traditional journals was no radical way over but you had I mean look if you're trying to make a presidential election at that time interesting to young people if you are basically turned off the political process you have to engage them in a kind of colorful and interesting and the government is an interesting personality and mix at that time is clear well defined villain so it was kind of setup for doing really good writing reporting and embrace the traditional coverage of the bloodless and I went and broke all that apart and became the most compelling writer and reporter on that campaign as everybody will acknowledge what was he like to work with the mean was he a reliable way is he reliable some of the word erratic hundred Circle love we call handling I mean he was erratic in his movie An energetic and all of the map but he was also a professional superb reporter Brian Rider deep sense of responsibility about things and though he would work in to the very last minute deadline and almost drive me crazy and bring you right here in the end yet we still are you could always count on him to do so so I was I had a great time took a lot of my time it was draining exhausting thing do but the net effect was to produce a brilliant piece of work in terms of cover the entire election and was also one of the key things that really finally put links on the map and a big way yeah everybody in the press corps was reading Every on the campaign misery and people are riveted by what he had to say but by that time we're pretty serious rock roll magazine pre why the respective style advertising lot of advertising record companies and that we are away so that was in Indy we would know growing pains well after about three years we went to a real brush with running out of money which lasted a couple of months because it moved offices sexism from Red Friel often appears place of big expensive new to expand them off so then all the overhead that entails and we're spending money without really thinking about all semester my God you're right out of money and with switch to a big national distributors are also now premiums like three hundred foreigner thousand and once we got through that we start and you know professional analyzing our management I mean really actually bring in people who are CP A's or had accounting degrees or had some weasel business background that can manage things and keep track of the money and over the years that just got more more professional but I knew once we moved we moved to New York in nineteen seventy seven I mean that really was finding it was really hitting the big why did the New York The Elijah Elijah Lee Francisco and seven said well we were yelled the company by that time was split into half of an service call and have are a lot of people on the writers and readers and so we had to do in one place and also the magazine business was in New York so if you want all the resources of talent they were veiled in your quest for the industry so was kind of <Music/Noise> brand that that's what we do and we went and did end up on Fifth Avenue at the time young you were quoted as saying Cisco is a cultural backwater and that so moving did you teach users some truth to that you really feel that oh yeah I mean there there was that heyday only started which had not only this thriving rock roll culture to thrive youth culture thriving political culture on the left of the black pants and all sorts of things wrapped presents and just sort of by the time we moved from New York was trying to have its moment has come back to life and we arrived just at that time was around four holes and then there's wasn't so much closer backwaters was it was just the provincial out on the coast was often the mainstream it wasn't putting up this big unique culture thing is that the the Gil yon trying to head into contracts or get myself into that then New York office in early nineteen seventies Rolling Stone was basically espousing a kind of counterculture a static but you're the boss man you were them and so has New balance running a counterculture magazine also being a boss and kind of having to be probably a jerk sometimes to people who weren't you know for active or whatever well I mean it wasn't too difficult for some I never quite believed in the counterculture or call that an altar call for maybe but definitely you know you had certain value systems of trying to go and try and be fair to people instead of being ruthless money only is the on the accounts so it was always a bit of a balancing act but I think every week we understand that they everybody wanted to get paid you know if you have families human support them so I don't think anybody really deeply question the need to have a prophet ethic and professional ethics I mean there were some outside critics in the early days of people owe your principles of this beer heavy capitalists and it's kind of contradiction out the stamp vote but I miss stuff that wasn't nothing I really paid attention and at that point were you just have to really get interested in the business side of things are you looking at tpy n Al's re looking at the bottom line were you doing that too well again I was myself doing is I was always had something there as CEO or CFO who had the day to day responsibility for all that and that person report to me and I look at our hse have oversight over it and try to understand and try to give directions and strategic advice but I didn't have control of the day out on this control get it but when you're involved in something like in the stages that when things are growing all the time in getting better and more might come in yet to be too tough"

taking a little bit of vacation this summer also hitting the road for a series of live shows so occasionally the summer going to replay a couple of our favorite episodes of How I built this including this one This is the first episode we ever did with Sara Blakely Spanx and if you've already heard it give a second listen I promise you're going to pick up on things you miss the first time around also stick around for the how you built that segment at the end because we have a very cool update for you from one of our very first guests ok here's the show room <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the middle <Music/Noise> meeting with her I could tell I was losing <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> so I said You know <Music/Noise> will you <Music/Noise> the bathroom <Music/Noise> because excuse me I go I know I know it's love where we just please come with me to the bathroom I want <Music/Noise> my own product before and <Music/Noise> and she she said ok the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> from NPR it's how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs and the lists <Music/Noise> behind the movements they built the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> Today Show the story of how Sara Blakely design a new kind of underwear and Spanx and eventually became the youngest female billionaire in America <Music/Noise> the summit a Blakely was going up in Florida didn't exactly dream of designing ladies undergarments sixty one to be a lawyer but which the current now SATs she failed twice the After colony get a job at Disney World as a writer reader and then in the early nineties and she got another job that was selling fax machines door to door as you are feeling demoralized with all the rejection and this people cause for saying in those listening please get out here we did was like water off a duck's back oh my gosh no I would feel very defeated and many times I would get in my car and drive around the block multiple times just trying to convince myself to walk through the door and sometimes I'd walk through the door and they were small offices were the whole office would turn and look at me at the same time get home and Thunderbird completely lose my nerve and just say oh sorry I'm in the wrong place and turn around and walk out so I stumbled my way through believe me and I know sounds crazy but what I was like fax machines door to door I kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie you know huh where's the director where's the where's the producer this is not my movie and I was really determined to create a better life for myself so had working there and they help you discover what it was you are supposed to be doing that that was when I first started wearing hosiery daily and I realized him figured out what the control top portion of the hosiery was doing for me in my clothes it was really making my clothes fit so much better but I had spent money on a pair of cream pants and ninety eight dollars on them which for me was a lot of money and they just hung in my closet and mourn because everytime ago to wear them you could see the under garment regular underwear left a panty line the song wasn't a great solution it also left marks that you could see and then that shape wear was so it was like the girls were so thick and overdone and I saw an opportunity for something right in the middle that which is create the perfect campus undergarments for women and I guess I should say for people who've never worn Spanx it's like this is an under garment made of elastic material that basically Titans and smooth everything around you your butt and thighs yes and so when I cut the feet out of my own control top anywho so I could wear those cream pants the light bulb went off and then I started pursuing the idea like how do you then start to build a business like did you have any money digit access to capital digit of wealthy friends or family I had set aside five thousand dollars in savings from selling fax machines door to door and that's what I started Spanx with and so the first thing I did was started to research if the idea existed and I went to the Georgia Tech Library in Atlanta every night after work for the week and a half researching every penny has patented ever existed and then probably on the seventh or tenth day of me being in there some guy came up to me because you know there's a website called US PTO dot G O V I said no what I scribbled it out of my notebook is like you couldn't search putting up at me and it'll search for years though that website became one of my best friends and once I determine that there wasn't anything that existed in a patent for me and then wanted to see if there was any market appetite for tea on myself so I literally went and asked one person I went to the Neiman Marcus down the street from my apartment when in and asked the sales associate if she thought anybody would ever want something like Footloose Kenny has to wear her pants and her face lit up because yes in fact save lots of customers have been making their own homemade version of that because there's no right under garment to wear under a lot of their clothes and so that was my whole focus groups guy but that's it Okay there's a market demand the the the the head you ever sewn anything in your life like for you to the background and decide oh no had alike manufacture stuff now what did you do have to even start to think figure out what material you need to use I've never sewn I've never taken a business class in my life I didn't have anybody in the industry or even know anybody that worked in fashion or retail and so what happened when I came for the ideas I just started taking other penny has and then I went to Hancock fabrics down the street and all these different arts and crafts stores and started trying to paper clip different pieces of elastic to the bottom and different pieces of ladies and you know obvious they didn't get very far and my idea actually needed to be made on a machine and that's why I really <Music/Noise> to give me the time a day to see if I could even make the prototype and in the meantime you are you still selling fax machines write YA because I needed the money coming in that the health insurance and all that comes with that so I was working on my idea at night in on the weekends and when I kept calling all the manufactures that I found that were mostly in North Carolina on the phone in not getting anywhere I mean no one would take my color they didn't you know as learn from Michael calling days you gotta be there in person so I took a week off of work and drove to North Carolina and just started cold calling manufacturing plants see just showed up and said like make me a prototype yes so I walked in on the door just cold and just said Hi <Music/Noise> meet City owner in there like and you are they always ask me that they've requested that they and you are in and say Sara Blakely have made Faye and you're well I had faith there lately and you're financially that kind of like the ones they can imagine not needing let you know most of them like Have a Nice Day It's great to me too you know where they just not interested in the idea all we have a manufacturing plants didn't get it all and I found it very interesting that all I was meeting with her man and that it kind of became clear to me what had probably been so uncomfortable for us whole hog because the people that were making them weren't spending all day in them you know and so if they were they were not admitting it so I had a hard time explaining why this product was so important and they couldn't wrap their mind and I was basically coming in and disrupting an entire industry been looking at something in <Music/Noise> a decline year after year but they were making hosiery to be seen on the leg and I knocked on their joints that guys I just want your hosiery material and I don't need to be seen anywhere actually going to be hidden under clothes it's a new type of undergarments so had to convince a manufacturer to take you on to make the prototype well it took a few visits to North Carolina and a lot of really persistence they all sent me away at first and a couple weeks after I left one manufacturer Highland Mills in Charlotte North Carolina the owner called me and he said Sarah Tham I've decided to help make a crazy idea and I just pause a diary was about to jump outta my chair and is the really <Music/Noise> the change of hearts than all the set is I have three daughters and so later I found out when I got the chance to do it that he had run the idea by his three daughters over dinner and they said Dad this is actually really good idea we think you should give this girl is shot and he still didn't understand it or think it was a good idea but he said that my enthusiasm and Mike my confidence in how good this idea was going to be stuck with them JP know that we were getting snow so when I came up with the idea I kept it a secret for one year I did share my deal with people like manufacturers are lawyers or people that I thought could help me bring my product to life but I was very careful right away it was just a gut feeling I had to keep it to myself because I believe that ideas are the most vulnerable in their infancy and its instinct to turn your writer left in that moment and tell a friend or tell your husband and you know when you do that instantly egos invited in to the max and then you end up spending all your time defending and explaining it and not for selling it so I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't turn back no matter what I heard I'd invested enough of my time and had enough sweat equity into the idea that I told people and that things I heard where you know honey that such a good idea why isn't somebody else already done it and will leave if it is the good ideas there I you know you're going to spend your savings on this and then in six months the big guys will just knock out of the water and that was all coming from a place of love but I feel like if I had heard that the night that I cut the feet out of my penny is a probably still be selling fax machine so once you started to come up with something that you felt was really special and unique remarkable teach you did you begin the process of getting it patented I didn't so I went to three different law firms I couldn't find a single female patent attorney in the state of Georgia and I even called the Georgia Chamber of Commerce they said there isn't the hope that Obama did my best six lanes to three men with their happens and I know I they were very nice they were not super impressed probably with the idea and a sale could be between three and five thousand dollars to pan it so I decided to write it myself and I went to Barnes and Noble on Peachtree in Atlanta and bought a book of patents and trademarks and I wrote the pattern and then my mom's an artist and so I asked her if she would sketch me in the prototype for the pattern that is the picture from the U S patent and trademark Office I went back to the one lawyer who gave me a little bit more of time of day than the other ones and I said listened and I have written my own pattern I have done all of the work except for the claims that is the part that I am not trained for I don't understand how to do that please I need your expertise is or any chance he would do it for discounted price and he was blown away because you've written basically the entire patent yeh sab for seven hundred and fifty dollars I'll do it over a weekend all right the claims portion of your Patton see you so then you got the patent yes but you know there was a moment in this journey that was quite funny I when we're in the final stages of the claims the lawyer said Sarah there is I need to know it's technically in the garment from the fiber and yarn level and I said ok only one person a call on that's Ted and Ted would have become my friend in the back manufacturing plant North Carolina and Ted had the most thick Southern accent you've ever heard and what if every there was intense and so I called Ted on the phone and said Ted my lawyers on the phone and were trying to finalize the pan can you tell me exactly what's in the garment is like yes there are seventy percent nylon and thirty percent lacquer I said OK grades them I learn are writing a good angsty denim up all night guy the night before I submit my pattern to the US patent trademark Office and I'm thinking how is their laughter in this product like how is that possible I called Ted the next morning i said tat its era we weave spell lacquer for me he's like yes L Glass CRA is the poem I guided flight from OK OK OK they think oh my where my do it all changed Margaret's lycra and um he laughed already has you know if that's even got a patent there and try to make cameos that appealed to enter the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> House surrogates tanks into the department stores

buy a ticket you can go to NPR presents dot o RG the state title this From NPR and I rise at this point in our story Sara Blakely has designed a new kind of shape wear and then she wanted to get out into the market the first ship to come up with a name for the name was a journey but since that time I cut the feet and my pantyhose at all the time I launched in stores was two years and I'd been writing the names on scrap pieces of paper everywhere I was you know and most of the names were on the back of rental car agreements because I had great thinking and in cars and I wasn't getting anywhere with that I didn't like any of the names and I knew it wasn't right and then I sort of narrow down my thinking at one point in time and thought Kodak and Coca Cola are the two most recognized names in the world what do they have in common they both had a strong k sound to them and I had the friends that were stand up comedians and I knew that the k sound make sure audience laugh so I just like that is I know I don't know but it said its unknown trade secret on comedians and so I thought you know what I need to have my invention have the k sound in it for good luck and almost as soon as I neared my thinking down that way the word Spanx came to me while I was in my car I saw the word across like in my mind across the dashboard of my card I pulled off the side of the road and I thought that's it and I went <Music/Noise> tell anybody and I wrote down that game can have and I <Music/Noise> PTO the G O V at Tyson and I sat there and stared at it for awhile and at the last minute back space and deleted the K in the ass and put in an act I dread made efforts to better for products in real words do in the year to trademark and even though it didn't actually have a candidate had still the case thousands so I felt great about it and name just right it says byproduct was all about the rear end and it's about making the rear and look better and no panty lines and so the word Spanx was kind of naughty and kind of funny <Music/Noise> a little bit risky and it just all work tonight and I hit send and pick of the hundred fifty dollars with my credit card and a couple months later I got back an official certificate from the government saying that I was the proud <Music/Noise> the word spank <Music/Noise> kids you've got manufacture package and a name how did you just are selling it my very first account I called on was Neiman Marcus how did you even get in there I called dumb guy I just love die when the Yellow pages and I looked up at the Neiman Marcus number in Atlanta and I said Hi I'm Sarah invented a product can I come and show it to the lady laughter goes up ma'am we have a buying offices in Dallas oh well what's the number she gave me their number and I started calling them and I just kept calling and trying to get to the hosiery buyer and I called for days at different times and she answered the phone and I took my shot and I said Hey hi I'm Sara Blakely and I invented a product that is going to change the way your customers were close and if you give me a few minutes of airtime all fly to Dallas and show you what she say she said Well if you're willing to fly here I'll give you ten minutes of my time and I say great and I jumped on a plane and I flew to Dallas and I was in the meeting with her and she was this beautiful woman impeccably dressed him at the Neiman Marcus headquarters I have a Ziploc bag for my kitchen with the prototype in it a color copy of the packaging that I'd created on my friend's computer and my lucky red backpack from college that all of my friends back to me not to bring the food fair and you cannot go to the murders headquarters with that read E's pack old dingy back by the death of my good luck charm I have to admit they were really pleading with me the the so so happened the middle of my meeting with her I could tell I was losing her and I just knew as my one shot so I said You know what Diane will you come with me to the bathroom she does pause she says excuse me I go I know I know and love where we just please come with me to the bathroom I want <Music/Noise> my own product before and after and she she said okay and you walk down the hall with me and I went in the Stalin had on my cream pans that were the reason I invented this without Spanx on in the eye when the Stanford Spanx underneath and came out she looked in she goes Wow I get it it's brilliant and she said I'm going to place an order number to put it in seven stores and see how it goes well and I couldn't believe it I got the car and I was shaking and I called them from the manufacturing plant the Pharaoh I meet more I just landed <Music/Noise> Marcus and <Music/Noise> the posit that there was nothing on the other and the phone for it seem like a minute ago Sam are you there the Sarah don't think this a long way but I thought you were to give these away as Christmas gifts or something for the next like five years what do you <Music/Noise> Marcus just the good and I <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the AJC you are in the Neiman Marcus are you thinking I have made oh my gosh that is the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make that is when the work to get his fur so I paid people basically friends to go buy the product and create a buzz about it because I was like You know I got to have these things move off the shelf for the buyers not going to give me any more chance we paid people to buy them yes I've called every friend I had in all the seven cities that Newman's sent the Spanx to and called friends that I hadn't even spoken to since fourth grade and you know kind of like Hyde Ferrer me from fourth grade do you mind going to the store and buying thanks and I'll send you a check and it was really tough because I was one item in a department and a new brand and I didn't even get a whole row in the hosiery department got a pocket I thought Oh I needed to do whatever I could to maximize this chance and I went to the stores and I would explain that the product was I would demo and ensure that the before and after picture that my friend talk and then I would stand in the store are from nine <Music/Noise> opened until about five or six every day so basically doing everything ya and I realize that one of the biggest challenges I had was that the where my product was being sold in the store was an issue is being sold in the hosiery department and my customer was in the shoe department and she was ready to wear department and so I started realizing I have a challenge I've gotta get my product out of the department it's supposed to be sold and to hedge had to do that well I went to Target and I bought stands you know free on the Lopes and I ran around the storm put them in every cash register and everybody thought somebody else approved it so the captain then you <Music/Noise> like Neiman Marcus moving your like how Spanx like next to the cash register and they just assume that that was like some high ropes said yes to that issue other than that how are you letting people know about where you are selling it it was a lotta a lotta hard work for me to get the word out I mean I've never advertised things is fifteen years old and we've never done any formal ad campaign or anything it so it's a very word of mouth brand viewed had no money had to get the word out and you do things like I reviewed sense to Oprah why did I sent it to Oberoi it's of note and which turns out she ended up picking as her favorite product of the year how did she even find it in the piles of mail she gets well I found out that Andre her hairdresser got him and put them in her dressing room and she tried and put him on and has basically worn in everyday settings house so went after she liked picked up on them to dislike to the orders to like flying at the door I was sipping pantyhose the women are the banks all across the world physically from my apartment so that's an enormous opportunity and then another thing I made a decision that was really you know unconventional at the time I decided to go on QVC that he challenged the shopping tell ya and had a lot of people say Sarah your brand is at Byrd George Goodman and Neiman Marcus you can also sell on QVC or kill your brand and I just I just said Guys I'm going to be the one on QVC and I'm a control the messages can give me enough to explain what this says and I you know I felt confident in that and they gave me five minutes of airtime and I sold eight thousand pair of Spanx in five minutes and hell is after you know a year of standing in department stores across the country on a really good day I'd sell between you know thirty five to seven D pair in a day and sales muscle and muscle it kept going up because I read that by the end of her second year you may like coming in like ten million dollars to do that feel that it almost feels like too much too fast it was great the great I never was doing for the money you knows I wasn't really the ever that focused on it I mean I can even remember after couple years of Spanx I'm still in my apartment and my account kept trying to convince me to buy a house was like and I'm not interested in my little brother was always calling and telling me different ways to spend my money he and I just it was really just for the art of it like I loved I loved being able to pay my own rent and stand my own two feet is a woman that was a really important thing for myself but it was really just I love making the product that you have like early on to get people coming to saying listen you've got a scale of fashion the money on investments Company and let me help you figure this out yeah I did I had all kinds of things come in at me in the beginning and still do you know fifteen years later but I remember one of the most interesting was within the first six months I started having several people come up to me and say what your exit strategy and I had no idea what they're talking about because I've never taken a business class and it dawned on me that people actually start things just to sell them and you STILL ON hundred percent of company yes did you ever think the company would fail in its first few years no I was always nervous but I was always so connected to the product I was so I was so creating this before it happened to have something fact machine's door to door I was I was thinking about it I was writing about it I was visualizing it I was preparing for it I thought you know I don't have the most money I don't have a business degree I have no idea what I'm doing in manufacturing or retail or any of this but I do care the Mosul to see what happens when you see the east the things we see things like Aunt Sara Blakely self made billionaire is that we're weak see that you can see that number that were yes this very where Dev reminds me of in middle school there used to be these things in the malls we could go and take the magazine cover you wanted to hug your friends that we all go in the booth and we'd smile and then we'd be on the cover of Vogue or whatever and just says it feels very surreal to meet the the Sara Blakely founder of Spanx fifteen years on the company has continued to grow and as yet to go public and please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things that your building the first thanks to one of our sponsors American Express open every week how I built this we bring you stories about entrepreneurs who beat the odds overcame obstacles and made their ideas happen it's never easy and that's why American Express open wants to help with money and know how you can turn your ideas into impact get business done learn more open com Me Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time for how you build that and they were actually dead check back with someone who is on the show last fall time John Arthur the sound or friend as she and friend issue is like a low key tender ways of making <Music/Noise> and just a friend based on things you both like to do like gardening or hiking or playing music and the moment there are users that have things in common with you you'll get a notification that you have friends waiting so once you get that notification you can meet them or you can keep sliding on other interests spent several months trying to get friend ish coat it and to work out some of the kinks and when she finally put a beta version up on the app Store on iTunes last spring and most of the feedback she got me was kind of disappointing the biggest criticism was that there wasn't enough people on the app so naturally we're based in Orlando which is where most of our users are but if you downloaded the app in Wisconsin or in Berlin <Music/Noise> London's there just wasn't enough users for people to feel like the app was functioning so they didn't have that experience is almost just as that is and not <Music/Noise> at all but then about a month after we first spoke to each entree she got some good news she applied to be a contestant on a <Music/Noise> show called Planet of the afternoon she got and it wasn't a typical reality show like The Bachelor <Music/Noise> like twenty girls one guy <Music/Noise> this is the search for the next great idea this show is produced by Apple and its more like a shark tank for techies have sixty seconds on the escalator to get them choose to be a potty approach it Umar because of the interest letter I believe the greenery and you can probably imagine what happens next if the show's advisers like your idea you might eventually get a big investment in your app Chandra can tell us whether that happened to her because the episode she was on hasn't yet run but he says he was really cool they'd just be on the show you know during filming a lot of people from Apple would be on sad or just you know kind of hear back from seasoned professionals about your app idea for people to look at your idea in a different way that you haven't considered is just it was amazing Tiger's episode of Planet of the apps will drop and a few weeks which is roughly the same time that the official version of Friend ish we'll go live on the app Store I hope that I'm becoming a success story for Orlando tech ecosystem so I'm quite happy to still be on this journey on the roller coaster open in fall anytime soon but I"

promises <Music/Noise> months the <Music/Noise> literally <Music/Noise> fit <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> guy's <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> force <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I walked in <Music/Noise> with the little <Music/Noise> like just <Music/Noise> those rabid <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the uh the the arm it's how I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movements they go the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> to not say showed how bleak my class tee turned a goodwill mission into a multi million <Music/Noise> shoe empire and created a business model unlike anything anyone had seen before the the so I should probably let you know rate yet said here that today's show is going to be a little bit different because normally in the first half of the show we hear the story of how an entrepreneur painstakingly builds his or her business from the ground then and then you know how it goes from there right in normally it's just one business but with my Husky it is not just one because before he even turned thirty he already launched for companies and some of them did pretty well and as for his best known business Toms Shoes already begin to get there for awhile so hang tight Blake's very first business dates back to the mid nineteen nineties when he was a freshman in college growing up he'd been a pretty good tennis player he even played against any erotic in high school and Blake was recruited to play at Southern Methodist University everything was going according to plan that is until one day when he injured his Achilles tendon I've had this big cast on crutches and was unable to play tennis for for several months I have to rehab their thing I can do is actually can carry my laundry down to the facility in the college dorm and so my laundry was piling up in my <Music/Noise> was probably not liking it that much and this is hard to believe that this act before any search engine so we had the yellow pages and I remember looking in the yellow pages to find a place of come pick up and deliver my laundry back to me because I physically couldn't do it and I and there is nothing like that and I in Dallas that I can find the time has come to campus and do that and that ultimately led to my first business which is called Easy laundry late partnered with his roommate and eventually they figured out that the key to getting customers wasn't for the students but actually through their parents so the next year his roommate got a booth at the freshman orientation the parents are kind of going there since signing up for everything or get in the books they get the death again that gets the lottery thing and they don't know how long we've been in business or every kid on campus does it or not but gosh there's a chance to sign their kid up for something it's not that expensive will help make sure that the kid zone ruin their clothes their freshman year they haven't been used to washing and drying your clothes and says in some time that they can use for things made a pretty good tension within the series like two or three days we did like eighty thousand dollars in prepaid laundry sales for the year from there they actually expanded to four other colleges in Texas and then they were doing so well that Blake dropped out of SMU to focus entirely on the company and after a few years they decided to sell it so at twenty one Blake walked away with about one hundred thousand dollars and lots of time to kill yeah I actually took a trip out to Los Angeles the first time to take a little that I'm off visiting friends are going to school here and when I was in L A I saw all these the huge advertising displays inside the buildings now growing of a Texas I never seen that I never seem like a massive ad for an iPhone or a movie or whatever you know painted on the side of the building yet there was a lot of that in Los Angeles and I notice that there now is a lot of that but there is almost exclusively advertising movies and TV shows so the specific industry the L A was known for I remember saying there's actually sing at Mel's diner on Sunset will never forget this moment and I was looking at this massive ad for I think one of the first Jurassic Park movies and icing this is so powerful it there's no way you can tune out this type of advertising is bigger than life it's it's it's it's exciting I wanted to go see the movie because of that the wall scape so exciting and underneath it had a name of a company van Wagner knows a company that owned the space so I called Ben Wagner and Saturday IDs company with one do some really big in L A and salt is added to you is can I rent this side is building on Sunset well actually have a yearlong contract with Warner Brothers for that once we camp we have smothered in town as of how much would it cost one entrant this one and he said something think you said it was like eighty five thousand dollars monthly high for saying you are of course pretending like you said yes you just want to get the information I just hear it yet is he says eighty five thousand eighty five thousand a month why some thinking hold on that mean that building owners making over a million <Music/Noise> a year just by renting the side that building and he has two sides because the building faces sunset to the play's two million dollars on one building and I thought and there's no cos like all you doing is just painting or putting the vinyl on there's no like actual billboard structure steel and all the stuff you have to do like this it is incredible had to start thinking to myself like who would pay eighty five thousand dollars in like why because there's no way that can make sense on a no cost per thousand or an advertising metric in just nine of people The Drive and Sunset was thinking yeah n sue the reason I basically came up with my mind was that had to be ego driven yet had to be that like all the studios in town when their movies on the note on the street they want to show the actor or the starlet like I can put you on this building unlike how big a deal that an Isaiah Nashville that I'm in I made a quick assumption that the country music industry had maybe not as big egos but definitely some videos in town and what if I put country music stars inside the buildings I was at is that we did yeah so I went back to Nashville and got after it in and found out that you know there's no one had ever done this in Asheville by and it was very challenging to get the city to allow me to do it ultimately I had to convince the city because the Highway beautification Act which kept people from putting any new billboards to think like after year nineteen eighty four something so what I ultimately came up with after liking are countless city council meetings and discussions and this and that was I was going to actually make the city more beautiful because I was going a great country music art and so I did was I actually would put the album cover of the new Dixie chicks Schneider joining us whoever was coming out an album but there would be no like Call to Action know like available at Best Buy for ninety nine it was just the art of the album and by doing that to convince the city is adding to the landscape of Nashville which is all about country music so what do you call them up and say he had this idea all you have to do skinny decided your building and you get focused and get cash so yeah did the thing don't ever want especially when you're twenty two years old trying to talk to fifteen sixty year old people who own apartment complexes you don't use the word idea because it's just an idea then it's like you not inspire lot of coffee CIA because people can say I don't like your idea I don't believe your idea of you say I have a business and what we do is we lease you know the side of your building and will guarantee this amount of money per month and we're going to resell the side you're building because we specialize in selling advertising to God because music industry and you'll make money on mass at the You Never thought you'd ever make money wow you have to basically hustling a little bit hahahs okay there's no doubt like Mia anyone is an entrepreneur especially if they start really young I mean you gotta fake it t make it and as you know and I was I was never being dishonest in saying this is what I'm doing and they had nothing to lose like by signing a contract with me then they were basically saying OK if you go out and lease this to the Dixie chicks of say and you can lease it for ten thousand box and give me thirty percent of that just for me allowing you to do this that's the three thousand extra dollars a month to replace it may be is charging five hundred dollars a month for apartments of a C I just created six new apartments that they didn't even have to take care of had you get the first company or who were Will able to agree to let you work with them to put their album I like how did you even have those connections and has you make that happen it was this cold calling you know I mean had found out who had albums coming out its research and then I contacted the marketing person said Hey <Music/Noise> try to promote this this album and I have a way you can from it larger than life right here in Nashville it's going to make a big impact on you when the first to do it Ms Roth things that marking people love to hear Yeah and and who's your first client was the first piece of art that you put up inside of a building Amy Grant and we did on the side of Ramada Hotel in downtown there's a picture of me and my partner has helped me at the time standing in front of it you know on the cover The National newspaper came out and it was great and once we had that with credibility and then we just started yes on Right Left what the label pay for that I think we charge for that one had vowed I would say fifteen thousand a month so you're probably catch on about ten thousand a month just for that one wall do you think you have the confidence to do that because you had done the laundry business and in college yeah I learn to live for that long it is nineteen mm so I've been you know kind of hustling in building and having employees and learning about customer service and learning about these things for about four years or so when I had this idea I had a little bit more confidence and had nothing to lose you know it's like they're in the CS they weren't and our boys been good with you now like just taking chances and and see what happens so eventually you left Nashville at which his company so I am selling the company Clear Channel big media company that was really big in our advertising we ended up having walls in Asheville me expand it to Dallas to and once I got to Dallas I realize that this is like a big business game like I'd had some small successes but it was very quickly that the big companies like Viacom Clear Channel's Van Wagner's they were on my game and it can be hard to compete with them said you walk out of that deal more or less sat pretty set yeah I mean everything is relative right but I definitely had a nice cash flow coming in from that that I wasn't having it you know jump Dell and find a job so I moved L A It was more kind of for fine in exploring what could be next and I was fascinated with reality TV how is becoming so popular is like right after like the first Survivor came out guess they just fascinate me I think the competitiveness in me the adventure that you now like all that and I My sister and I was thinking about applying for Survivor we actually did apply for Survivor you you want to be contestants on Survivor yes and the casting people survive are also casting this new show called The Amazing Race and they called us up and said Hey I don't think we can put you and your sister aunts arrived they knew about the amazing race and so they can talk to send to thinking about them in the race and so we got into the process of being interviewed for that and we got on the actual show itself was thirty one days so we literally disappeared from our world for thirty one days we can really tell anyone we're doing for the super confidential disappeared the <Music/Noise> US for my country to country yet of the world and <Music/Noise> I think the <Music/Noise> noon we're done the hard part was the show was airing for another you know couple months and so we can tie one happened yet we wonder if we didn't win or how far we got an A and me not to spoil the ending for anyone because it is guaranteed as to what you you barely almost won us almost one million bucks yeah and they flew didn't think that that would have been a positive thing at that moment but probably wouldn't have been good for my further drive from an entrepreneurial standpoint CU sits the Amazing Race and Eve Soldier Company and what I mean at this point you are kind of like twenty three twenty four in five New Hampshire twenty five you've got this check coming in from Clear Channel U I guess presumably you didn't really have to work if you pray you have to hole at yeah I mean I was never really about the money like a man every business of ever start has been more of a curiosity and a kind of what ifs and so as I just got off the amazing races looking around and seeing how popular reality TV is becoming in kind of understand the basic metrics of advertising in what advertisers want and targeting in all that I just got really excited with the idea of a network of really having your own channel on that would be complete focus on reality and reality TV star like the cable TV channel did you it's just amazing to me because I remember when I was twenty five I know I was pretty hard it was foreign correspondent just random like you know start my career stuff but I mean I don't know to be twenty five year olds who think least our cable TV channel like that's that's a pretty bold idea to have a new twenty five yeah I mean absolutely but I felt like you know I feel it is possible like it just seemed like I was in this position I start to understand by being on the show would interest the people hadn't just about finding the right people that knew how to do it and then figure out how to channel their energy and get the right capital together to do it so so did you raise money for it so I did so i basically a track down the gentleman who is the founder of the E channel and somehow got a meeting with him in any kind of sad look like it's so competitive now to start a channel now it's probably about close to a million bucks maybe seven and fifty thousand dollars you need just to get the lights turn on and I said why I differ don't have seven or fifty thousand dollars to just kind of bet on this right out the gate but I do know some people who really understand reality TV and who has money that maybe did invest in my idea was to go to all the winners of the reality shows the last two years and get them to invest you said you guys should all invest let's start a reality TV channel because you caught one yet and yet the money that a million bucks or whatever yes and I got them all to invest and innovate some <Music/Noise> within a couple months theres seven or fifty thousand And we launched what was called Reality Central CU race money and then and then what did you start like producing a reality show the whole idea was that we acquire the content for next to nothing ah you know it it to re show and then we would actually do come like Mystery Dinner Theater where you had someone come on is on the shown Kentucky through the <Music/Noise> app wow that's a good idea yes the week was tough but you know so we really didn't have to rely on the continent is more about trying to get the distribution which ultimately was the cute seal and wide in work and we had to go to like Comcast and Time Warner and Charter in these big organizations that are cable networks to host all the channels and convince them that they should give us a slot of the one of five hundred channels and ultimately we couldn't convince them of that it's funny because I hear you tell the story and I think of us somebody who has really tried to make the world a better place and I don't know if you're twenty four A Reality Channel would've made the world a better class would have and I'm so thankful that it didn't work I would buy buy one shoe myself that I was running my chin yeah yeah I mean there's something genius about and something really horrible service after about a so so so what happened with all the people including you put who put money into it unfortunately all lost or money it was really hard I was pretty depressed for a while ago everyone was challenging so when that all kind of collapsed and what did you decide to keep Leah which is next so companies are three that that I think the the overarching theme of my entrepreneurial life which I'm really thankful for has been like there's been no connection from one business to another it's literally been me falling kind of my curiosities and the serendipitous conversations experiences I have and so the next business was totally that way I was actually at a barbecue as we were kind of closing down the Reality Channel and one of the people that work for me they had assigned us fifteen years old and use there and I was asking him what he was doing that some are making small talk and waiting for something and he told me he was doing drivers ed and i saw this guy be so exciting and learn to drive he responded like totally uninspiring <Music/Noise> mean he just said like yeah it's okay now I go this place and the teacher's boring and I pretty much sleep for the class and will first off this is not good our future drivers in L A are sleeping through the driver's ed class that doesn't make me feel good by getting on the highway in the second thing is like I mean getting your license should be like this amazing experience for fifteen year old and and there's gotta be a better way to engage them yeah and I just thought gosh like all these teenagers trying to be online <Music/Noise> you know maybe there's a way to ten to take this driver's ed instruction <Music/Noise> into the technology to a teenager for a brace so I had this idea to start a new type of driver's ed company we would do all the instruction online you have to pass things in a sequential manner see to really make sure that they're learning they're paying attention like they can just cram for the final test they would have to get the stage is almost a video game and I recognize that one of the ways to get them to pay attention and be more excited about the actual learning to drive was to have driver's ed teachers that war going to hold teenager's attention and the best way I can figure out to do that was hired only models and actors actresses time she would basically hire like attractive people as the super attractive people that teenage boys and girls be like you totally idolize think that any that would spread fast on the Internet there's a lot of people in L A that or you know the need part time work the flexible schedules between auditions and trying to make it and I'd really like you found some guys are already in the business of online traffic school in driver's ed and they kind of really knew the business and we ended up being partners and I was a thirty three percent partner in the new company formed together with these two other guys headed you get the word out about it once again the unread mail flyers in all of the old flyers flyers at high schools you know lots of that lots of year targeting on MySpace but he grew really quickly just to clarify to listeners we are going to get to the good that you did the worldly will get to that we will get that so it's a you got this force business to drivers of business that is going really well and I mean could you have just continue to do this car thing for ever never or I mean did you think that that was going to be the rest of your life I never think Man I never thought like when business was going to rest my life probably until Tom's The The <Music/Noise> The The The Lake Mike asked me <Music/Noise> back how a random conversation and wine bar in South America to

good money he's live in a great life but he was feeling a little bored a little restless so he decided to take a break and do something a little unusual he got what I learn to play polo in Argentina and was actually after about being down there for about three weeks when I met sir and if Asli a few women that were and wine bar that we're talking in English which is nice because Mr. Cohen speaking Spanish I didn't understand most of what they're saying and what I passed about what they're doing they explained they were doing something they characterize the shoe drive and what that meant was they were going around collecting slightly used shoes from wealthy families and when Cyrus to take two children who did not have shoes and couldn't afford shoes that needed them to go to school and I was just really taken by either passion for this project and the fact that kids just outside of when Cyrus didn't have shoes cuz that was something new <Music/Noise> asked enough questions to get interested and they offer me to come with them and help distribute the shoes and I said sure they said to send you one just check out this next couple if they were going like a week later and I was going to be down there still in CF so what happened when he got down there the experience was amazing what I mean I didn't have really any experience of at this point about volunteering or being in place of poverty and that I saw all these kids really light up when they got the shoes <Music/Noise> knew she sees reissues but they kids were acting like it was Christmas Day and their parents are excited and there's joy in after we put the shoes on the kids we played with them a jump rope played soccer we did all these things and it was just a great day and so I went back that evening I was talking to my old teachers in the Lego about the experience and that in telling him what a great day I had and how you know how satisfying it wasn't going on and on just you know in your gushing with with enthusiasm and he and the essay question I really wasn't prepared for he said like that this is amazing what you've done and I commend you and doing this in my country and knows what area you're in today that's a very challenging area for the families and he said but what happens when the kids grow out of the shoes are when they wear out of its own pair going to wear out of them and I said gosh you know um I don't know and his question Can haunted me to be honest Gonzales and I thought gosh did we actually do something good or did we just further propagate a problem that they're going to have down the road and I remember that night like actually having little trouble sleeping in kind of wrestling with this this question he asked So look of the next morning and when things I've done since I was like fifteen years old as I write my journal almost every morning and I was having a cup of coffee and writing my journal and kept thinking about this question and an awesome link out to this idea of like okay well i really wanna help these kids which I really did I really connected to this group maybe I go and all my friends donate shoes a couple times a year and bring him down the man thought well and that's once again depending on other people's donations and what if they don't do it and in a day doesn't seem like a very sustainable way to give these kids shoes and then that led to you now will what if there is a business now instead of a charity in donations what if I actually started a shoe business and every time I sold a pair of shoes I would give a pair away by what kind of shoes did you have in mind at that point bull you know at the same time in Argentina for about a month and I'd noticed that a lot of the pool players even for the girlfriends were wearing these shoes called The Opera God and it was kind of like an SP drill type canvas shoe that was very different than anything I'd ever seen the USA and just like the Magic came together with caution what if I sold the shoes that everyone down here is wearing to people who've never seen them and come back here and give away shoes to kids in need so what you had even started so we just started meeting with people in town that made the shoes and asking them like a key chains this keychain is that they offer it's crazy because what they all know what the country in Argentina everyone appreciates shoes they're really inexpensive and they work on disposable and they were not something that put too much investment in so people could buy them in every month or two a couple months is a kind any new pair and so they thought some of our changes and make the shoe way too expensive but it may understand that we had a market would pay because you are paying forty bucks for caravans if I can make someone had the same you know kind of longevity than they would pay forty bucks for this and these were just like small time art is no shoe makers are with these people make in their garages or make an omen in different small little barns in factories and things so we got some ideas and they are typed them really rapidly as they were smaller organizations and and we made a couple hundred pairs of like prototypes and in the name Thompson was birthed are created and there too because when I totally what i wanna do I said I think if we sell a pair of shoes today will give away a pair shoes tomorrow will come tomorrow shoes <Music/Noise> and our slogan will be shoes for a better tomorrow this is all around this word tomorrow and when it came time to put a tag on <Music/Noise> couldn't fit the word tomorrow's on to tag tag was <Music/Noise> heel so we shortened the word tomorrows to Tom's and at other times <Music/Noise> and in so you get back the US have eight pairs of shoes to <Music/Noise> about ten or fifteen and in what was your idea could just see if this would work like because you could have come back to the US and people said I <Music/Noise> about these or you could have sold them all <Music/Noise> and then what yeah it was definitely I mean I try to stress this to people I mean of all the businesses that I started this was the least business of that"

uh we are it's how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs and idealists <Music/Noise> behind the movements they go <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> today L A former Navy seal turned an old cheap Jitsu belt into <Music/Noise> come to our ex that <Music/Noise> it all when the Cats made up his idea the it's unlikely you'll find a gem in America or for that matter in most parts of the world without tea or extract and if you ever marry with them these heavy duty nylon straps that hang from an anchor in the ceiling with these foam rubber grips of the S and with the simple straps you can do rose or lunges pushups or pullups you can slip your feet into these <Music/Noise> and working your core <Music/Noise> your ex is like a full <Music/Noise> workout machine <Music/Noise> Hess it is just two straps hanging <Music/Noise> the company says that today more than twenty five <Music/Noise> them in something like ninety five percent of all <Music/Noise> sports teams in the US use <Music/Noise> about the concept is <Music/Noise> and founder of the company already had Trick literally <Music/Noise> fit during long deployments <Music/Noise> seal this <Music/Noise> back in <Music/Noise> seven and at the time Randy and his seal team <Music/Noise> to fight pirates <Music/Noise> we were <Music/Noise> waiting <Music/Noise> what was going to happen in the days <Music/Noise> turn into a couple weeks and you don't really have a good way to train other than stuff that the Romans did in the way back you know pushups and squats and situps and none of that gets you really prepared to climb the side of a freighter with you know eighty pounds during your back and I had accidentally deployed with my Ji Jitsu belts stuffed into my bag and scooped up of my cage with a flight suit and thrown into a bag without realizing I hadn't as I was sitting there on the Scot listen to guys gripe about not being able to work out I just got this idea that hey I wonder if I went and tied a knot in the end of this silly belt that I deployed here with through over the top of that door over there what if I could lean back and pull my body up and I just kind of created this movement that looked alot like climbing a ladder and then figured out <Music/Noise> my body weight to loaded up and that was you know that was the spark of inspiration and gives Phenix and doors in this warehouse to you connected to the first one was actually a bathroom door and yeah I just tied a knot the end of it through the top the door closed the door and leaned back and started to lift my body weight against gravity which turns out to be pretty effective pretty versatile like wrapping the ends of this like just a belt and just doing pull ups and things like that yeah imagine that you had something to look like an upside down Y ride at anchor and that goes up over the top of the door and then kind of two arms that come off that as I stitched the two pieces together with his hand all that we would use to repair rubber boats with and you know just lean back and grab each side and started figuring out when I can do those I can do curls can do shoulder flies if I turn around and lean away from the door I can work the whole front side of my body chest presses chest flies standing planks for my core and use it as a balance point to do squats single leg squats lunges and it just kind of became like a flower that continue to open up and expose new pedals you know the more that I worked with so when you started to like do these exercises in this warehouse waiting for a mission to begin with the other members of seal Team think about it well me yet I realize it's a group of the pack alpha males said the first thing they do is come over and mock you as it were the hex Connery and then but then very quickly the seals are innovative cats and when it comes to you know exercise everybody sorta interested and so literally you know guests are gone and women try that Lucy could we do this that we do this and you know over the course of the next maybe three six months I just kept tweaking and you know guys would have ideas on Amy we should put loops in the end of it in an advanced at some level but then it kind of froze at the level that I thought it needed to be because I never viewed this wasn't thing about business I just thought it was kind of cool that I created this nifty tool that guys liked and wanted and so I had a friend who was a parachute rig are out in the air aloft two started making them for guys in exchange for a case of beer and he'd call me and say you know a boss you know Jones want to make when your gizmos that OK and I'd say yeah go for it and over the course of a couple years it just cannot proliferate within that unit so when did you start to think hey maybe <Music/Noise> know they can do something with this while I was promoted out of the field and at that point my wife was sort of done with the super hero gone all the time lifestyle and had a promotion out to the west coast in her career and so we can to cut a deal that I would apply to business school at Stanford and if I got <Music/Noise> resign my commission and move out there and I thought that was at that point the safest bet honors kids and had mass and twenty five years I was very good at it even back then but to my astonishment they took me in spite of my scores and this is round in two thousand one yeah and I I went out there and all I was at Stanford I was able to go out in training after training center and I would show up with my straps and hook them up in this world class training facility over the course of six or eight months main darn near <Music/Noise> of the coaches that would be in there with their teams came over and looked and said hey tell me about this thing now in ten minutes later they be selling <Music/Noise> what a great idea it would be for their Every Everyone other athletes from a ninety pound female tennis players to their three hundred pound linemen and that was when I started think huh I wonder wonder if if if I can do something with this yet and I ended up deciding to take the summer between my first and second year instead of going off and do in some cushy you know paying internship with Mackenzie I bought a fifty dollar forty year old sewing <Music/Noise> off Geary St some little sewing shop and I sat down in my garage I knew how to sew because as a young seal officer you had to go out and buy a case of beer for the rigor and have him teach at SOC can customize your gear and so I had some rudimentary sewing skills and and I just you know started creating some different versions of prototypes in optimizing the design and what were you making it out of that time nylon you know cord or a nylon <Music/Noise> I would buy bits of hardware that I needed and I put put the thing together and so that summer you were just basically sewing up a bunch of different versions of it or you were just making the same thing over and over and over again no I probably did fifty different versions and it seems funny right when you think whether things just to darn strap but there's a lot of different ways can make a strap it turns out and you know I'd make it and I'd I'd try it out and how well right that's a little better but that caused some unintended consequence I don't like so I work around that and I have any money so you know I probably spent a third as much time with a razor blade my hand stripping the pieces back apart so that I didn't have to reorder them as I did sewn together but over time you know you sort of workout the kinks in by the time that I got to my second year in business school I had to stabilize prototype and I also during that summer I had gone over and found a guy over in Hong Kong manufacturing rep who would make short lot for me of Alpha prototypes say you you get through the summer and you get back to school in the fall and and what did you do that you'd like bring it to classmates at business school and say Hey try this hour how are you then testing it I became <Music/Noise> you know a bit of a fanatic with my idea and I mean anybody was at Stanford Business School between two thousand won in two thousand and four will tell you oh yeah I remember that cat you know is I I snickered everybody in on every class project that got assigned I turned into a incubator if you will for what would become TR acts and we had to vent sometimes on Fridays the blow off steam they were called liquidity preference functions which basically meant tapping a keg and hang out together and I would bring out my straps and get people on and it was this great incubator where I learned all kinds of stuff and and it was one extended focus group that taught me alot about you know what people liked and didn't like about this contraption that I was proposing to sell see you you graduate from Stanford and and what do you just you decide I'm going to launch this thing yet by that point I had you know I had had my mindset that I was going to take a run at this and I was a little old to be a recent graduate of the business school program I was the Granddaddy of my class by about I don't know for six years you were white thirty six ye thirty six and so I figured I had one opportunity to try and fail before I had to get serious about you know paying job you know my mentors at Sanford time we're trying to convince me to do something more sensible this is just a stupid idea well at the time Garth sole owner was was one of my hand at becoming the dean there he was one of my professors and he said you know Randi I can I can get you any number of great paying jobs in Silicon Valley with your background you know them too This Hat and But I sorta had my headset on it and so I got out and then when after it so had you even have the money to to start to manufacture these into it to build a company I didn't have any money because you know my my career as a government servant hadn't produced the giant pile of wealth that you would have hoped but I did have had about fifty grand in savings and I put it all into one of the first steps the initial prototypes and pursuing a little bit of key intellectual property which thank goodness became really important even recently what you do did you just file a bunch of patents for for this the same for their acts there were some unique characteristics and those designs that that I had created that I thought were really special and would fundamentally differentiate this product from what I was successful as expected to be you know or heard of of copy cats and so I went and patented those unique features and I found some trademarks on kind of the key terminology that I was going to try to build our brand around branding was one of the concepts that I really learned at Stanford <Music/Noise> in two thousand and five when you realize the company how you start to get the word out about but that the system because this was not me this wasn't anything really like it out there that you get people to take it seriously while I think a lot of people didn't take me seriously initially but I I didn't sort of the least sexy way possible I drove around initially around Northern California in my car with my wing man blueberry my dog in the passenger seat and a backpack full of straps i went gym to gym to gym to gym doing these little presentations to their staff trainers and I <Music/Noise> have to beg the fitness manager to give me half hour of their weekly in service with their staff and I would leave a couple of straps behind me I'll bet you that I did in the first couple years after business school I probably did between three and five hundred presentations around the country and you would get the skeptics for sure <Music/Noise> of the big dudes that were used to throwing <Music/Noise> they would soar to look at me like a you know what is what is this this little girlie machine that you get here but I would quickly this abuse them of the belief that it wasn't for them and then after that right people would sort of be interested in I would leave a couple behind and it was just one gem in a time when trainer to time I started to make little progress the end and we are getting a lot of orders in the first year first two years well I mean a lots a relative thing from zero ten is a lot and so yeah I started to get when I viewed as a lot of signs of life and I was fulfilling them out of this this really get a pathetic little almost shed that I was renting out in the western edge of the Sunset District in San Francisco and I would be you know I was everything I would fulfill them I had a little ink jet printer and was running the quote unquote the enterprise software out of a desktop at my feet and then you know that I met a gal who was a waitress by night but would help me with office stuff by day and we just started to plug away in ship out of everything happen out of that little fifteen hundred square foot shop out in the sun said what was it was a turning point when did life start to feel like this thing is really taking of what happened well it's funny that you hear people talk about tipping points my experience is a little different I think it's kind of a series of tipping points that you know they get relatively bigger if you're fortunate over time but one of the early ones was I went down to a to a trade show down in San Diego called the idea World Fitness Convention and I set up a ten by ten booth down there and I had this kind of faked or that I had put together an anchor it and we ended up selling out everything we had and have my assistant overnight me you know what we had left in the shop there so the second day the show's a three day show the second day was basically selling paper futures and then the Thank goodness the product arrived on the third day the people come and exchange their paper for straps and that was a big moment because I realized I write these traders are skeptical on but if they think this is really a great fan right now I'm cooking with some gas you know and so that was kind of tipping point one and then shortly thereafter I started to get exposed to some athletes and ended up connecting with a cat that probably most of your listeners have heard of named Drew Brees very <Music/Noise> in his career so before he became the Super Bowl champion quarterback for that for the Saints before he became the Drew Brees that we all know to them and he was the same guy then but you just didn't know about him and he said he had just torn has his rotate or cuff in his throwing shoulder which for quarterbacks tend to be a career Ender and he had just been released from the Chargers and was doing rehab and he fell in love with the suspension trainer wow thank goodness and so did that was that would start the love attention for for the system what he ended up when he went to New Orleans he ended up Santa me a tranny to me half dozen of these all taken with me and you know I'll see if I get the Saints to start raining on and he had opportunity with Sports illustrated early on to do a story about his comeback and he was very kind and you know just a sort of scratch my back made sure that the picture that they featured was HIM training on the suspension Tran Ha and all the sudden all the strength and conditioning coaches and athletes that read Sports illustrated got their eyes on this crazy strap and thought maybe we'd have a couple of those you know the big challenge for somebody who's starting a venture in particularly if you've got a product for which there isn't precedent the big challenges obscurity and trying to get out of obscurity and get up on the on the radar when you don't have much money is very challenging and at first you think that's you know boy once we once we break out it'll just all be duck soup from that point forward you know I was I was envisioning napping on piles of hundred dollar bills but it didn't quite work out that way because as soon as you start to hit scale then a whole other host of challenges begins to avail themselves and you have to wrangle each won one of the time but lately when for example one of the specific challenges that I faced early was the manufacturer that I had started with was a good guy but didn't have a depth of manufacturing experience the product that I was brain which is this product has been very durable and so one of the very early large lots of inventory we ordered arrived and we sold out of everything so course were at a stock by the time it arrived and desperate to ship we hooked up the first special treasure lean back and he handles the just cracked like potato chips and it turns out that this manufacturer had gone to a sub manufactured and found somebody would do the sub components more cheaply and hadn't mentioned this and we have time to send this stuff back and so we ended up having to <Music/Noise> strip these things apart seven s basically an assembly <Music/Noise> saw when we got a bunch of the plumbing pipe from Home Depot and literally had to set up this little manufacturing plant and if you will in our little office there and that was inefficient to say the least but we managed to work our way through and survived it but I had several product problems like that that came from the manufacturer trying to improve its margins and this is something that in the manufacturing world people called quality fade and it's a big problem when you manufacture through China so we have this Sprite down in the world and I would think that once you start to become successful it would be not cuss me that would be other companies that that the total this we can just crush this guy because we can just make a similar thing in and make it cheaper or whatever Yeah that that is the single biggest problem that I have faced in my careers not Conor and frankly it's a it's a problem that is be doubling the entire consumer products space these days it started with us literally about six or seven years into our evolution had somebody call me and say Hey I think I just saw a counterfeit T Rex I said that's impossible it's impossible right and it turned out that in fact the rise of the Internet was changing everything and it was creating an environment in which these little manufacturers over in you know rural China suddenly had visibility over products that seem to be hot so if you have a one size fits all say for instance a Gucci bag or leave it on bag that has a high sale price but the perception of a low cost of goods you end up being a perfect target and we had an explosion of counterfeiting that just rolled across them are good and really threaten to <Music/Noise> cause us to fail you <Music/Noise> coming <Music/Noise> how the legal battle against copycats buried <Music/Noise> it feels almost sank the company you're

limitations apply me hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR's Guy Raz so it's around two thousand ten and T Rex is catching on with professional athletes and spreading to Jen's across the country the problem is the exercise straps are also popular with camera feeders and the knockouts are eating into the company's bottom line so Randy decides to hire an investigator to figure out just how many can Outfitters are out there <Music/Noise> they found <Music/Noise> twenty different factories <Music/Noise> scattered around <Music/Noise> we're all creating fake counterfeit T Rex suspension trainers wow and yeah it was it was really it was a shock and put huge pressure on the entire business model is if you have distributors they're trying to sell the authentic product at full price but then they get these kind of shadowy operators that pop up all around them and the Internet enables this in a way that past generations of entrepreneurs never had to deal with and so pretty soon you know it's it's they're everywhere and figuring out <Music/Noise> that was job number one soap had it would you do have it you squashed he's these guys were eating into your business they were devouring my business here's the stories are legend of companies that had great promising futures that basically went out of business because of counterfeiting I think that I was fortunate in that it was the early stages where people were starting on the enforcement side were starting to get a sense that hey this counterfeiting business is bad and we're going to have to do something about it so customs was starting to ramp up its efforts and fortunately counterfeiting you know is a felony so when you identify them everyone wants to take them down and so we started this process of seizures <Music/Noise> with the cooperation at some level with Chinese police and then in the states in Europe most of the customs agencies would see is the counterfeit goods so that sort of started to subside but what replaced it was that the counter bidders figured out if we don't put this brand's trademark on our product and we just copy the actual design itself but without the trademark then it's technically not a counterfeit and so it becomes much harder to enforce against and that was the next big wave was the knock offs that were copying our designs to the table but not calling themselves Tea our eggs that he became in the bigger problem wow what happened what Amazon in the other online marketplaces but particularly Amazon because of its scale became this hotbed if you will an auction site for all of these knockoff vendors who would miss appropriate are trademarks use them in search marketing and so we knew for instance guy came looking for T Rex on Amazon you would be served up our product alongside the host others others that are accorded the price of fifty oppressed because of course they're not having to spend any money to develop the market or get you there yes we really experienced a flattening in actually a negative growth for a couple of years twenty fourteen twenty fifteen wow as this sea of knock offs confused the market and I mean look you are an alpha male you're a seal your Mammy die I mean let's be honest there's no way you didn't experience anxiety or depression or like fear all of that all of that maybe even a few tears guy you know above admitting that it's because because look there there was a period of time when I was thinking well I could make these guys go away right I have a certain skill set but you know then you have to look away from the light quickly and say No this is not your brain should go you know I I learn some skills as a seal about how to manage fear and stress and it sort of involves a combination of compartment was a sian and action and so that's how I can have you know deal with entrepreneurial fear and stress is you know you put in a box figure out how you can take action on it and then you move forward to your next task at hand and hope that you know that fix works so I thought at that point did you like what you do ultimately we we decided that we had to take the dreaded step of our first litigation action and we picked one of these knock offs to go after with a federal patent and trademark infringement suit because we knew if we wind it was unlikely that we would be able to collect any significant damages because these these knockoff companies don't end up maintaining much cash on hand but we knew that as a legal precedents it could be what we needed to clean up the marketplace and so <Music/Noise> filed a federal patent suit and trademark suit against one of the largest in for injured <Music/Noise> so that's a big pain because that requires lawyers and paying lawyers for the hourly billing rates and that's that's super expensive and that must've been stressful just to do that <Music/Noise> it was really painful and quite scary you know <Music/Noise> just a frame it up the rule of thumb is that it takes about fifty thousand bucks to <Music/Noise> file a patent right to life the absolute minimum that that one should expect when you try to enforce it is half a million that's all that if you settle right before court we ended up in our action end up spending about two and half a million bucks it took about three years"

financial supporter of NPR but we thought the story of how the company came to be was so interesting that we want to tell it you anyway so curious that <Music/Noise> capitalists are like the truckers with credit cards in as long as you take them to <Music/Noise> they will help you pay <Music/Noise> but if you don't take them where <Music/Noise> they <Music/Noise> throw you out on the side <Music/Noise> so I did not trust <Music/Noise> I like to make <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> to control <Music/Noise> go public and <Music/Noise> out of the car the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> uh the uh I built this show of the innovators entrepreneurs feel it's <Music/Noise> stories behind the movements will <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> guy rise in on Today show how life in <Music/Noise> commune inspired John Mackey to start whole Foods and with it and organic food revolution that changed the way Americans shop for groceries if you happen to step into an organic food co op in the sixties or seventies you would probably walk past piles and piles of bulk bins full of beans and brown rice and dried fruit there were no big brands no Stony Field Farms are nature's Path Amy's are an easy and the people who shop in the stores they were among a teeny tiny handful of Americans who even knew what he know or kale work and they were mostly counterculture types hippies back to Major folks my mom and yet all these people were at the leading edge of a food revolution that would start to sweep the country in the nineteen nineties indie revolution was largely propelled by Whole Foods and even though that company inspires pretty strong opinions fanboys scam haters there's no denying that it's had a monster sized impact on the way we eat but the person who is partly responsible for this revolution well here's what Chan Mackey cruel at meetings start today with the cocoa puffs and milk pop tarts very picky eaters while so hamburgers for lunch with nothing on it from the vegetables <Music/Noise> maybe fry chicken for dinner macaroni and cheese out of a can or box this was the era where stay home moms were so thrilled about the great innovations that could happen like TV dinners a kid frozen TV dinners that you could just pop in the oven and voila you have a meal for your family where were you in life when you first discovered food like real food my food consciousness awakening really occurred and is about twenty three and I moved in to this vegetarian co op in Austin called Prada house I was definitely interest in the counterculture I thought I meet interesting women as well I thought it was a good adventure yeah I expanded my diet from inside to become a vegetarian again the food buyer for the co op and then I had to get a job and went to work for small natural food store in Austin called The Good Food Company and wow I'd like it was launched on my path I loved everything about natural organic foods I like cooking I liked retailing it and I thought this is something I could really be passionate about at this point <Music/Noise> you did not like you have a college degree really kind of trouble out of college yet so I was about twenty years old <Music/Noise> on track to get a degree in philosophy from University of Texas but I ran into a course that was required course I needed to complete I didn't like the course I didn't like the books I was required to reside in like a professor one <Music/Noise> and I stood up in the book I was <Music/Noise> read through <Music/Noise> can read this book the I just began to read books and take courses <Music/Noise> was interested in signing up with hundred and twenty <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I was interested but I took control my life I begin to be authentic and true to myself and that led me into this whole <Music/Noise> where <Music/Noise> So when <Music/Noise> when you show up into this school year because she creates I'm assuming it's Cal like a hippie type plays yeah this definitely is a classy your parents are super excited and proud of the decisions you've made at this point in life and twenty three no my prims were very worried very unhappy at the very last conversation <Music/Noise> mother in nineteen eighty seven was on her deathbed and she asked me to go back to school and make something of myself I was a grocer I was a hit the grocer and I A she said and I have a fine mind John <Music/Noise> as a grocer go be a doctor a <Music/Noise> do something with your life that makes a difference and I said I'm doing something in my life that makes a difference he said You're just a grocer and said Mom grocer great so what was a likely what we like working at the health food store I loved it I mean the store was a very big only couple thousand square feet but the retail business was really fun I mean firsts on surrounded by food which I'm fascinated by with other people I'm working with the other seven or eight of us working for the store and there are also equally interested in food there people that you get to know over time and small store with not many <Music/Noise> develop relationships <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> do this to seems within my <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> worked about six months <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> no one <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> back to the co op and talk to my girlfriend <Music/Noise> she was four years <Music/Noise> twenty <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> often wondered <Music/Noise> That's too <Music/Noise> how my life might be different now <Music/Noise> she was very excited <Music/Noise> we began <Music/Noise> out <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> started <Music/Noise> well that wasn't easy and I make a joke about it now that an entrepreneur is a little bit like a pan handler except that they're selling dreams to people and we raise the money because we like most entrepreneurs friends and family we thought we needed fifty thousand dollars to start the store and come up with forty five but we decided we can make do with it and my initial stake was ten thousand dollars It's the most I ever owned or the company and ten of the forty five thousand <Music/Noise> it from my father so with that many were able to open up the first Whole Foods well original stores call safer way think Safeway but safer and truthfully we're always hoping that maybe the Safeway would sue us we'll get published <Music/Noise> and all those electives I had in school not a home or business class is no real business experience Renee didn't have an experience she was the time we open a store she was twenty twenty one and we open a store in an old house not even on busy road it was just like we just thought this was a super cool house so we had a store on the first floor a vegetarian store and get a vegetarian restaurant on the second floor cafe and then <Music/Noise> and we lived on the third floor if you if you were to walk through safer way what would <Music/Noise> shelves is elected all cry recently he was in need was there should ever know there was so we didn't we're pretty sure we didn't sell sugar we didn't sell me we were selling real fruits were selling bulk foods and produce and yes tough when everybody was happy that we had about the counting the people in the cafe is working <Music/Noise> time twenty people were ten or fifteen to twenty people so were you scared I mean you were you're still a kid <Music/Noise> no one scared at all you thought this was going to work well when you're under twenty four twenty five years old you don't have so much to lose I was <Music/Noise> any kids I for my case the worst case scenario was I would disappoint a lot of people and do something else in life it in for me was a grand adventure in the starting businesses fun fun because you're you're you're engaged and you're you're passionate about it and the whole dream just for swept us along way to know what we're doing but we learned very quickly and we got better use of burn through that forty five thousand pretty fast we did we actually lost half of it in the first year how loud the last twenty three thousand dollars for it worry you freaking out no but the investors were met my dad was freaking sure but I am I just began to read books I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds I have read hundreds possibly thousands books on business since the beginning I also I am in awe not flashlight try things but if something doesn't work I stopped doing it enabled us to learn quickly and we did make a small five thousand dollars profit in our second year had a Jew that certain managing our costs better yet started buying better less spoil image better management of labor hours into the very basics of retail we generally <Music/Noise> had to figure out who your customers safer way were they just like local hippies and Austin would you also have like sort of you know ice and high society people so one of the jokes I tell is because I run into people all the time that tell me they were originally set for a customer can I say the you know if half the people most of the <Music/Noise> safer way customers the been there whenever we have five times a sale we're having kind like the number of people that went to Woodstock right direction <Music/Noise> but now they were on they were all young they are people this was the counterculture in part of the counterculture was they wanted their own stores didn't get a traditional supermarkets very <Music/Noise> experience for me means so so obviously it sounds like you were doing pretty well when did you when you start thinking about you know expand <Music/Noise> well after about I began to make money the SEC here begin to realize a safer way it was too small and I just thought we needed to have a bigger better location timing <Music/Noise> opening a real grocery store where you could do all your shopping there to the soap we found this location was the sole nightclub on a big strip Road in Austin Lamar that it had burned down the crowded been a nightclub so I first had to try to sell our our board on it and try to get <Music/Noise> they said this is crazy lost half the money the fresh air and this is great making money now but <Music/Noise> money to stay there for a few years <Music/Noise> will see <Music/Noise> no <Music/Noise> come to a bigger store work for the competed not well positioned competitively <Music/Noise> but they were buying it and more losses said look we want to put more <Music/Noise> the baby could find somebody else to invest their strategy there being no one else would be stupid enough to invest in this company with this you know crazy entrepreneurs has been successful yet <Music/Noise> so I began to hustle <Music/Noise> that had money I'd already people that knew people I met him was playing basketball with that one day we finished playing pickup basketball and he got into like the end of the intro was the same <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> was Che <Music/Noise> and this A J doesn't do anything chase a millionaire <Music/Noise> much money from his parents <Music/Noise> well like a fair call the next day and it just turned out that shade had kind of his own food consciousness awakening and started shopping at Safeway love safer <Music/Noise> N J said he would put fifty thousand dollars it's like wow okay back to our board said gotta gotta skip and fifty thousand dollars N and it hurt and shock and several of them decided they wanted to kick more money in as well so what happened so we we rented that burned out location and the story there's also kind of interesting because the owner of the building was this guy named Ben Powell had been in his family he lives his attorney living in Houston time time there I had to go and selling on <Music/Noise> natural foods supermarket in his building I pitched him on and started laughing kind of towards the end of my pitch was Mr. Powell he laughed <Music/Noise> and he said <Music/Noise> John I mean this sounds like something seen a movie kind of corny movie said John your soul full of enthusiasm You Think You Can conquer the whole world <Music/Noise> will actually teach a different sign <Music/Noise> but he remind me of myself when I was Yeah let's do your GA dollar natural foods supermarket and so we were able to get that store open however while we were building at one of my friendly competitors but it opened up after safer way of course all natural version I really love the two entrepreneurs that we're doing that regular marks cause i thought these are good guys worked really hard to get a good store and I pitched them look we're going opens natural foods supermarket when the first natural supermarkets you were in the world should do it with us were they join you instead of yes letters exactly checkpoint op so much fun by the way if you don't wear only <Music/Noise> away from your site your story you're going you can have trouble competing with us what you told them that you basically said to them hey this is going to be clear let's work together and if you don't crash you know I didn't say it that way because that is sometimes funny thing is when I'm told the story that's how I get some coordinators I did threaten them I mean I said we're only going to be <Music/Noise> were going to have his big storage can be harder for you to compete when we do this together did today have any any of their own conditions yes one of Craig's in Mark's conditions as we have to make this for real store we have to sell meat and we have to sell beer and wine have to sell coffee we can't just be completely vegetarian idealistic store we don't want to partner with and I'd already thought Craig and Marc store was very successful in I talked a lot lot of customers cross shopped and they all wanted us to loosen our product standards to make it more real grocery store and was kind of like we know if we're going to eat these foods then we need to be able to we should sell them so that was a compromise that was made the turn out to be the right compromise from business to business decision perspective yeah and so the funny thing was they had trouble making up her mind about it may come down after a closer store up in our stores being constructed and then literally like two weeks before our store was set to open they had seen enough and they said where n how can so we had to we had to really scramble to me now we have tried to integrate our our our teen members together and to change the name and this is where the am assuming this will hold was going to come in well we started with the name market we are a market and then it was like what kind of marketer were a food market what kind of food market we were kind of a natural foods market that seems kind of generic collections natural market well common organic food market yeah but we don't have just organic organic from or what were some Whole Foods the net was at Whole Foods Market the other was our weekend with our name <Music/Noise> the woo <Music/Noise> woo the store was <Music/Noise> success people sometimes ask someone to take the first whole Foods Market to be successful in the answer transfer is it about three o'clock in the afternoon in the first day out was that just because of lack or was that just because of that was it was this is to the clamoring always an element of luck and success in life yeah we won the reasons I wanted to merge with those guys was not only because I like them and thought they could help us but I thought you know what we can get Clarksville and safer way <Music/Noise> have almost enough sales between the two stores to break even if we get other customers will never look back but again people were so excited about this first story was it was <Music/Noise> and we didn't do any advertising which is open the doors but no word <Music/Noise> of mouth was incredible the whole Austin kind of counterculture hippie community knew about it immediately and it just keep keep going like that from that point on No Line on tat reopens this is now in May of nineteen eighty one Austin have the worst flood that it happened about a hundred years and our store was located in the hundred year floodplain so we're actually where <Music/Noise> year flood plain but I said was I mean this as well about every hundred years are going to have a flood I said OK I'll take the chance the the the it <Music/Noise> been a lot <Music/Noise> weekend that ended it really started to rain on Sunday and I had gone home and was a friend's house <Music/Noise> and Renee started to call and said the waters <Music/Noise> beginning to rise what <Music/Noise> take the ball backs can pile up in front of the door person inside the store because we thought the water would come enter the doors actually kept the water out until I got about four feet lah but that store is <Music/Noise> a submarine <Music/Noise> about four feed the sheer weight of the water basically broke for the class of the doors which came in like a tidal wave of Renee <Music/Noise> up swimming out of the store that night and it was a Sunday and we have three days sales there was enough for safe so I want to get the cash out of the store and I went back is no lights couldn't picture it now with all the Power's out its nights I'm sloshed <Music/Noise> with a flashlight and there are actually people wander around the store looters were wandering <Music/Noise> and I went into the office an eye opener for safe was able to pull money out this was a time when we didn't take nobody to credit cards to more than half our money back then was just in cash I mean I think we had about nine hundred thousand dollars and put all this crush it and <Music/Noise> out the storms guy comes up to me a buddy to find anything good in the background <Music/Noise> is dark just grab this bag probably something back there for you go check it out and we got the money out and put it in a safe place and and we thought we were pretty much out of business there were cars floating <Music/Noise> street watching float away <Music/Noise> in the end just a moment after the flat and had chai Mackey to Whole Foods from Austin to Boston and eventually almost every state in America the guy Russ and listening to how I built this from NPR The The The The The The The The The The Hey Everyone Just a quick thanks to two of our sponsors who helped make

returns just go to M V empty watches dot com slash built with a tea to join the Movement me a welcome back to how I built this from NPR guy rise so it's the spring of nineteen eighty one and make his first Whole Foods store is literally under water only been open for six months and they had no flood insurance may get a picture with the store was like this tidal <Music/Noise> to come and when you have a flood like that all the sewage lines back up as well so you have all this bulk food and we need to finish in sewage <Music/Noise> a tall horrible mass and stock anyhow we showed up for work and we started cleaning everything up and all those other people like I recognize him but they were team members and they were ever customers and customers and neighbors and everybody was pitching at school and by all rights whole fish had died through the flood we had to rebuild the store can cost a lot of <Music/Noise> and we just didn't have the money so I thought we all thought we were finished but every one of the stakeholders rally that there was a benefit held for the store and the team members they work for free our bank loan is money on my signature which was worthless and <Music/Noise> that and investors decided to kick in more cash so we were able to reopen thirty days later I just pulled everybody together we're really united around that near death experience so did you focus at that point on and just getting things in order no I want to open a second store after the flood Lau was like we can put all of our eggs in a basket in my float down the river we've got to have a second store the second store didn't it didn't start as well as the first or it was up in North Austin was in the suburbs come away from the counterculture Community of Austin was trying to market to more conventional suburban people in it it took a couple years for the store to actually turn its first profit and we open a third store in Austin and South Austin know that that turned out to be very challenging for us because that store was too close to our original store and and caramelized significantly in together we started to lose money and today my cousin attention with partners well that led to a big debate because one of the partners Mark he really didn't want to grow because we have this gold mine he just wanted to mine it yeah so long or short it was that Mark sold his interest and the company and went another direction his life so he was the first co founder to exit actually Renee exited slightly before him because she and I broke up and she wanted to travel the world and see other places so she can in a new boyfriend and she left and doing and start a business together either brings you closer together or rip your pardon case of Renee and I ended up ripping us apart so then we just Craig and I laughed and I think a partnership is challenged when it gets into hard times good times or easy but did you ever did did you ever think to yourself maybe maybe they're right maybe we expanded too quickly may be made a mistake course I was thinking that I mean I was regretting opening the South Austin store because almost all the sales of God came at the expense of our original store so but I really wanted to grow the business I mean I must say all the challenges were like Oh boy another great challenge as it's getting it's really hard but a voice on is ok this is a great lesson for me I can learn something here I am learning something here I learned a lot from those early failures are those are the failures perps or the early trials so if you're looking to expand the business presumably you would have to raise some pretty serious money right yes in nineteen eighty eight we decided we couldn't grow as fast as we wanted to grow from just our retained profits tapped out all of our friends and family there was no angel networks we needed to race in venture capital this was a time in venture capital was not really fully cranked up like it is today yeah we hired a banker and we can to try to raise venture capital money and we got rejected again and again and again trying to talk to the venture capitalists they just couldn't get what we were doing I mean one guy who turned me down he said to me <Music/Noise> know John she got pretty good business here but looks to me like I let all the stores and you just a bunch of hippies new to <Music/Noise> in peace I don't think that's a very big market yeah it's going spread further than then the big companies are going to take a lot of interest I don't think it can compete with Safeway to compete with these big commercial supermarkets been running out of business people still tell me that today I've been hearing it for forty years but I mean he had a point back then we're talking about the ladies of course I'm sure the guys kicking himself to a heap on he apologized to me about ten years later saw the worst decision ever made it with the venture capital companies based in Texas or did you go to like Silicon Valley where were you looking for money to go to Silicon Valley and we got two based out of Houston but we were beginning to slowly cross over because we are not only selling natural organic foods but our quality of food was better so we are beginning to get a more mainstream shoppers coming in and that was beginning to drive some of our growth as we get to investors from Houston and we got <Music/Noise> of Silicon Valley and then what did that enable used it to just expand and expand more yes we sold thirty four percent of the business for an eight a half million dollar valuation so about eight times earnings or about twenty percent fifteen percent over sales that was it ridiculous that kind of valuations people get today compared to what we could get back in the late nineteen eighty eight is also when when <Music/Noise>"
"29","Masters of Scale","Beauty of a Bad Idea 11.mp3","so before we get a Masters of scale we want to tell you about another great podcast start up the back with a new season of stories about what it's really like to start a business and we think you might enjoy their two part series on the original social network France or host Lisa chow tells the story of their dramatic rise and fall she talks to Francis founder former employees and investors including the host of this show Reid Hoffman you can find start up on their website it can let media dot com slash start up on apple podcasts or which ever up to use I've been turned down a hundred and forty eight times that's Katherine Min Shu co founder and CEO of the muse a career development website that she pitched to investors hundred and forty eight times not that she was counting they were literally days where I had an over breakfast in over a ten thirty am copying the <Music/Noise> snow over lunch interest in TP and left a meeting earlier for her and I would go to drink and feel like I was being laughed at her and when we finally received our ground I went back and counted it was both painful and gratifying at the same time looking at other's names and again I remember that no Amber that no Arab or that know and they think everyone eating the the <Music/Noise> today the new serves users in the millions Catherine raise sixteen million dollars last year and her tail is the origin story of most great startups so if you're hearing a chorus of no's you should look for other signs that you're onto something I believe that the best ideas often appear laughable at first glance you would have incredible talent at every position you there are fires burning on the the the the the the easy way <Music/Noise> idea what the <Music/Noise> day the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> US is matches the scale I'm Reid Hoffman co founder linked in partner Greylock in your host I have a theory that the best business ideas often appear laughable at first glance the lesson frontrunners goes deeper than the padded vise he shouldn't take no for an answer you should expect to take no for an answer if you're laughed out of the room it might actually be a good sign I mean a test this theory by talking to some of the smartest people I know many of them have spent time in the rejection line but first a word from our sponsor zip recruiter why ask every candidate three questions and every job interview that I do that since Eagle co founder and CEO of the prick or hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate within twenty four hours we ask them to share the three questions he always asks in job interviews the first question I ask them is tell me about what your company dead and how it differentiated from the competitors if they can answer that question I know alot about what their relative level was in their organization the other questions will get to them later in the show and by the way masters the skill listeners can try zip recruiter for free go to zip recruiter dot com slash scale the Activision the Google Facebook LinkedIn care be and be the all sounded crazy before they scaled spectacular than the On this episode of mash of scale I want to help you see what the transformation from a crazy idea to include a good idea looks like and what signs to watch for <Music/Noise> we'll talk to several CEOs will focus on one on her journey from beginning to now start a city far far away from Silicon Valley so not one of those classic Silicon Valley the people that strips Walker the founder and CEO of Walker and Company Their flagship brand is Babel a razor for men with curly facial hair he started as a kid in the projects I like to have a whole row they grew from concrete story right yeah group projects welfare all that jazz had one goal in life and as wealthy as possible as quickly as possible I realize that there are three ways to do it the first was to be an actor and the uh <Music/Noise> uh <Music/Noise> workout for me too LOL the second was working was good fortune the years he'd face it am already exhausted to the re the left with such inertia the day came that realization I applied to the school Stanford Business School unfortunately and I learned in Delhi with the and you came to Stanford not even knowing it was like it was hard I had no idea Tristan doesn't sound like your typical Silicon Valley geek but I can't stress this enough you don't have to wear a food stained hoody to succeed here neither do you have to play World of Warcraft or write code until sunrise you only need to have a sense of curiosity and Tristan was exceptionally curious he wasn't just a student of business it was a student of every technological shift taking place around him as an accounting class at Stanford and remember I believe in him was to speak at Stanford and there's this commotion going on people wondering if he was actually going to do it is going off like five minutes and I hope it's winter and I just ask them to him becoming bare in mind this is two thousand and eight back when Twitter had a relatively cozy community of five hundred thousand monthly users Tristan was one of the more active members as luck would have it it was hammer time on Twitter thirty seconds later he replied back and turned around to my fellow classmates and say Guess Who's Coming see at that point I realized how important sweaters part in like the kind of innovations within communication where it was my first understanding of bad ideas being a good idea because everyone else around the tables why on Twitter what's the point of this thing I don't care about what she did for breakfast they just didn't get it and that showed me that there is something that has that kind of dive and so are we seeing the seeds of Christian success you don't have to be a key but you do need to geek out over the new idea is you want a level of enthusiasm that slightly out of step with your peers and Tristan was seriously getting out over Twitter he wasn't just an early user who wanted to help build the company site email twenty different folks <Music/Noise> to be separate from the company last person he knows David for Nick because he was a professor at Stanford and off the part at August Capital he replied back he said Come in my office to talk with me to question Tristan are you willing to work for free for the summer that's David Horn by the way I get happy to introduce you to Twitter I'm curious if you actually know what Twitter does yes rate and at the time they were thinking about the business model that sort of thing is fascinated by what it could become a semi resume and I'll send it out probably two days after that we have some email Evan Williams is the founder and former CEO of Twitter thing come in for an interview in a week after that the internship with wooden or her out six seven months with her accompany me think Tristan is lucky to get an email from EV Williams but notice the size of Twitter's workforce the top twenty employees total trust in spite of the company's potential not just the head of his classmates but ahead of the market has a knack for spotting ideas right before blast off David Horn Nick notices to Twitter was nothing when Tristan was excited about Twitter was ablaze that you told your body's you are heading to the park to enter at the time was a service reason I'm eating a delicious ice cream cone was entirely unclear what one did with Twitter how one could make money at twitter how big Twitter would become shortly after his Twitter internship ended he started his next email campaign he bombarded the founders of a fledgling startup called Foursquare and again the CEO Dennis Crowley responded email them a safe time Dennis sent me an email and never forget this verbatim he said this than you know what just may take you up on some of this are you ever in New York dens as an L A that I'm now sitting on the couch with my life and share plus get ten minutes later said to me and I actually was planning on being New York tomorrow I booked my flight that night flew out the following <Music/Noise> out with them for a week in a month later when his helmet for the company by now you may be thinking Holy cow CEOs are awfully response of creatures but before you start dashing off messages to the employers <Music/Noise> the dreams I should warn you the few stories and like Trista I've had the experience where I go walking at Greylock <Music/Noise> even waiting here all day to be chewing on like this is no <Music/Noise> continue walking to my car and I would try to get a reference <Music/Noise> this will get me to never pay attention to you again you go into <Music/Noise> file of people track that file exists but Christian's pursuit of Foursquare had a happier ending that's because he targeted teeny early stage companies start supporting people or less the lesson here is not just his persistence but as pressure since some people get lucky and border rocket ship by chance but to rocket ships that's no coincidence that's a sign you can spot an undervalued idea ahead of your peers it's like the Spidey sense that just keeps tingling it's hard to stay in one job even a wildly successful company once you started sensing opportunities all around you when I started the company gets your merchants Zero brand platform by the time I ended up leaving Foursquare even a couple years later we had over a million Russians on the platform by the time I left two hundred and fifty people I started with three and quite rightly Allen Goff building this thing for myself so Kristin left Foursquare in two thousand and twelve after building a business on the team from the ground up he then found the perfect place to plan his next move then Horowitz a founding partner of the iconic venture capital firm and recent Horowitz invited Tristan just to hang around the office and think Big Ben said Constance six nine months ago tuna do I spent all nine months there and elect assessment the first seven months my time they're wasting their time on his bill the bank wouldn't fix three trucking six BC in the country in the world right then inspiration struck I just got frustrated by the shaving experience better shaving experience may not sound like the idea on the scale of freight trucking obesity or banking but the most scalable ideas don't have to tackle dramatic problems they have to tackle neglected problems and the more that Tristan looked in the history of shaving the more you realize that was a hugely overlooked demographic men with coarse or curly facial hair who'd been living with the curse of razor burns and razor bumps for so long they no longer even recognize that was a problem let's just get a handle on this coarse or curly hair dilemma which all admit is outside my particular area of expertise I would rate ever for decades razor manufacturers have promised a better savings groups they identify the same problems are you sick of me that's an unsightly way to an offer essentially the <Music/Noise> more blades in every car threw one back two but three blade a lot more the right side blades to whisk away those gathered with friends and this ever growing stack of blades did actually improve the shaving spends a lot of next week at the Dow sixth grader on twelve hundred men to add three reported a smoother cleaner shaving experience but mostly work for why guys like me why guys was great here but the rest the population and especially African American men were experiencing a multi bladed assault on their skin their shaving experience got worse and this went on for generations until a dive into history open Christian's eyes to a problem that no one else could see the wreath out an old retired executive from the CBD company's interest and look at photos of Blackman hundred hundred twenty years ago none of them had reason to shave your station on the basis of the facetious halftime lead into stars means look it up with the flicker and Aiden to the generic search terms like our Renaissance Black in nineteen twenty that's what they wanted twelve hundred photos and find one with light and non cliche and face the added us the tools in nineteen o four when she was a gentleman named King Gillette he had this amazing <Music/Noise> said for hundreds of years Barbara seventies think all the straight razor to great efficacy customer level with this kid not beneath but using a straight razor some homes pretty hard to use if you're not trained the other side they say what if you can take a single blade housing within the safe head attached handed to a take home with you in shape and that started the mass market shaming industry as we know it the fourth one years later they lose the patent and many would argue that the only reason we have two three four five six Lee raised is purely due to protection but actually has less efficacy if you travel internationally single blade is more popular multi his solution he re <Music/Noise> the single blade razor and specifically for coarse or curly hair behold the devil became the flagship product for Walker and Company and the first step in His grand plan envisioned the health and beauty company on par with global brands like Procter gamble Company the devoted its attention to men and women of color it was blindingly <Music/Noise> obvious to him that this company should exist a lot of people say that they're trying to build the park to get people to talk about this for second but no one ever said that in two is interesting like I think folks talk about is if it's a nice kind of thing but people call the majority of the world where the parking of people call it what the hell is rocking em when you're pitching a room of mostly white mostly male investors can be hard to convey the urgency of this market oversight so how did the best and brightest feces responded Kristen's idea I don't know me I don't think it's scalable a terrible idea for me to kind of jump into the bubble thing because it was a consumer group didn't want an industry that is dominated by the multi blade use case with billions and billions and billions of dollars to attack you with pang protection et-cetera and to do it unlike Silicon Valley that's crazy as is often the case was one lone champion of many like that when you have quite frankly this may sound like a strangely <Music/Noise> reaction wash a single endorsement from an investor outweigh crowd of investors telling you thanks but no thanks should new way all of the feedback equally short answer no and here's why The first truth of entrepreneurship and investing is that the very big ideas are contrarian because the Tryon is part of the reason why a bunch of large companies and competitors haven't already done a bunch of other entrepreneurs haven't already succeeded at it and so that leaves the space for the creation of something and the great something big you have to have that initial space for example in the early stages of Google it was search is a terrible way of making money in advertising is advertising his time on site and what a search do it shuffles you off the side is bash you can go but that's not a good business model like an Arabian be it's like oh oh someone's going to rant a couch or room from someone else who are the freaks on both sides of that transaction so all of these things have a similar quality very smart people will tell you there's no there there you have to grade yourself for a string of rejections some entrepreneurs simply develop thick skin others treated like a normal part of the workday you know wake up should he listen to people pressure dreams it's a living the there's another more hopeful approach the arm Richard and had me talk with a number of entrepreneurs who pitch seemingly laughable ideas in all kinds of industries like Abby followed the founder and CEO of Global Citizen Year her not for profit send students abroad for your international service between highschool and college back in two thousand and eight she was struggling to get funding and she turned to a leadership coach for advice we asked her to share that is the nose are actually a gift you heard that right gift and he said between now and when we talk two weeks from now I want you to go out into the world and gather as many know as you possibly can now it is your home or to be rejected over and over and over and over and come back and report on and ended up being the most important they could have ever done and most important advice I could have been given at that point the most successful entrepreneurs listen closely to the nose they mine the rejections for clues Katherine Min Shu the founder of the muse got her share of rejections over the course of one hundred and forty eight knows she shared the top of this episode we asked about the reasons that investors turned her down a bit too early for us but didn't touch one few hundred thousand monthly active users gimme a call this is a Fool's errand it's expensive it doesn't scale that's not very tech that's not a scalable platform aren't you worried that you're going to lose all your users once they turn thirty and you know have babies or you know I get that women in New York and ten with this goal of this product but I think you can really have a hard time finding women who care about their careers once you go outside of you know the coasts and I just remember looking at the people in thinking that you know a lot of women is right ask this question she knows more about women than most investors she also knows more about her business entrepreneurs have to learn how to hold on to what they know through the arduous process and you're golden the founder and CEO of hint Water takes a step further when she was hard work on a recipe for a flavored drink with no sugar preservatives a big week in the beverage industry officer pointed advice what I want you to notice is how careless and his rejection she didn't just hear no she saw the breadcrumbs leading to our own company success his response was the Americans' last week that really interesting that he just called me sweetie you know in the business person I zoned out of the conversation came back and realize that somebody at a major beverage company basically was sharing with Maine You know without him knowing it that was really what that belief was that the major soda companies that Americans really love we answer that was before that they were taking in the road and that I needed to put the gas turning pro this before they decided to come down my fork as well turns out the care is critical is wrong to the tune of ninety <Music/Noise> a year that's how much revenue hit water takes in from Americans who supposedly have incurable sweet tooth is at this point you may be thinking about your own counterpoint to my theory sure Karen calf and ultimately secured financing and prove their critics wrong what if you're pitching a truly terrible idea how can you learn to hear that more in a moment after this word from our sponsor zipper we're back with Ian Siegel CEO of the recruiter who has another job interview question that he considers indispensable the third thing I always try to do an interview is find something that the candidate is passionate about and try to get them to get me excited about that thing because so much of what we do is narrative building is storytelling and such a key part of communication is the ability to convey our ideas and get others excited about him can you think of one candidate who brought up a subject that you thought I never could be interested in this and gradually convinced you oh my gosh maybe it has little interest I had one candidate who's really in a passion for so did develop a passion for passion fruit stay with us to find out and you can try zip recruiter for free right now go to zip recruiter dot com slash scale that slippery critter dot com slash scale the Division I meet so how can you tell a truly bad idea from a bad sounding idea how can you be sure your ugly duckling could become a Swan this is the key you have to pay attention to the quality not the quantity rejections you want to see at least a teeny minority <Music/Noise> investors were you don't have to get them to a yes but you should attack some fiction as a reason their way to a no Christian has a keen ear for this quality as conversations he can pinpoint down to the PowerPoint slide number the moments his audience stops paying attention to slide in there I think is like sly fourteen were talked about proactive acne system as like a kind of a good analogy to what we're trying to do it's the difference between kind of Gillette double as like Neutrogena practice assist them it's all very important issue in this PC look me and never get this said Tristan Asher issues related to raise about shaving irritation are as profound and big an issue for people as acne I was quite a sight you kind of understand what you're saying but all you had to do is get a photo in black men aided them in the said This is a permanent thing I do it does get on the phone with ten white men and or of them with said The same Thing one and two new to get the same ratios so it wasn't that it was like a bad idea or not is important is that that person was unwilling to acquire the context necessary to understand whole working on just laziness that point I can't fix that so I just gotta move on until I find somebody to notice how quickly Trista is mine moves on to the next investor inequality the questions drops he knows mid pitch that the conversations over the rest is noise those half hearted questions I like the elevator music of the pitch process it's meant to pacify on spinners in fact crates of them also waste of time Tristan will tell you he prefers a hard no to a comforting maybe I mean took a million messes with the all the time we want to invest in people who can execute with something that the pedigree chasing a significant white space in a big opportunity for us is like check check check check and we are nine types and those like how much his right knee just like trying to say something that I want to hear as opposed to telling the truth and wish that I can tell the truth a little bit more Tristan is <Music/Noise> interesting question here how much of this investor hemming and hawing as well so it's really going through their heads as a partner Greylock I want to share what happens after offer leaves rose and investors left them all over the crazy idea that begins with a debrief of the investors partners if I'm presenting I did my part as a Greylock and they'll go that's great we should do that I'm like hyper smart people and no one say watch out for this or watch out for that it's too easy the idea so obviously good I can already hear the stampede of competitors trampling over our hopeful it'll start on the other hand you don't want every person in the room to say read my blog then you wonder am I drinking the Kool Aid in a very bad way what you want is some people going you guys ready or mines and some people going I see it you want a polarized reaction to take my decision to invest in air BB is an example David Z told me during the air being the de brief David C is a partner at Greylock investment well every venture capitalist has to have a deal it doesn't work that they learn from every N B can be yours and David's is a super smart D C He invests them in ten invested in Facebook invested in Pandora he personally return to a half billion dollars to Greylock spawns he's a smart smart money gets and believe me I weigh is just as carefully as some of us foreigners David disagrees with me I worry but I also get excited it's an emotional roller coaster and is this sort of emotional turmoil plays out in the background discussion it's hard to give a notch for hard know the best ideas make you want to say yes and no in the same breath this mix reaction can strain the relationship between investors on cars the one point example my friend Josh problem and the founding partner at First Round Capital tweeted a picture of a letter he received from us Byrne founder it was a message printed in huge black letters the center who <Music/Noise> wrote here Josh we'll see I think you've already yourself over by getting left out of this deal Josh common as we well that's one way to respond when a VC basses but I talked with Josh and that tweet doesn't even begin to capture the full range of emotions he experiences when he turns down a founder so why not just kind of personal question Why did you tweak a letter was the impulse it wasn't a mock Him it was just almost show that I recognize I have a privileged life just because I say no it doesn't end there it's a hard thing not to miss you're an optimist the job is ninety nine percent of the time were saying no and so you become a VC you have to try to figure out what style of VCU are great but I actually found that when you're going to pass being able to be explicit and transparent about it and also doing it up from the same experience you had when I was raising money there were three types of PCs my favorite was a quick yes my second favorite with a quick no and my least favorite was a long drawn out maybe show me this improve this I knew I wanted to be in class one or two and that's why optimize for quick yes or no one the palm of the top three BC is actually damaging the founders and the really just kind of play out their own image their own option on this and that's exactly right why say no I'll just wait around who could maybe if something changes I'll get a shot and it is very damaging for the many founders because they're optimists they have happy years they hear that as though this PC is interested in what they really should be doing is just saying thank you let's move on to someone on the other hand I've got quite a long way to condition the list so their pillows founders there are plenty of time he's ever in the portfolio so often wrong are there any particular founders that you passed on that you're haunted by yes the obsessed because the list is long I like the way that Josh describes his list of missed opportunities every VC including me has a list like this an anti portfolio the star she might have funded witch cast a long shadow over conversations on spinners and if you as an entree or see a flicker of the shadow cross and investors face that should give you comfort ultimately you need to get used to being a lone champion and there's a question Tristan poses to himself which is a good question for every entrepreneur who's in the depths of a grueling pitch process what do you fundamentally feel that you're the best person in the world to do really be awful about that you know increasing million little bit and really think about which you're uniquely qualified to teach us that it may be that there is one hundred thousand people could go solve this problem if they knew about it they're motivated by those hundred thousand you may be only one who knows about it can assemble the resources and wants to do it one of my favorite quotations is from Robert DeNiro movie Ronin which is if there is a question there is no question and the parallel notch leadership does not have an absolutely solid theory of committed differentiation you not have competitive differentiation and it's really important to have competitive differentiation example if you said at the beginning of Ling dan what was my differentiation differentiation as I understood vitality am I an expert on careers and the job recruiting market plays and higher <Music/Noise> bite no right so I'm the unique perfect person doesn't mean that when you line up every attribute you turn out to be the only person as action fact that you're taking a unique shot and you have a unique ability to take that shot relative to competition and watch a certain of your competitive advantage will no longer feel like you're waging a quixotic battle against conventional wisdom you'll feel like the world must eventually come around to your way of seeing things I think health and beauty is doomed for all types of reasons I can suggest and talk to one particular really sticks with me and still does to this day I think all global cultures led by American culture which we live a black hole to us and more recently seen an Asian culture the big frustration of mine is my living is adopting region on the planet"
"30","Masters of Scale","Grit 10 MIX.mp3","I'm Jim Cohen signed the executive producer for masters of scale and will show in just a moment but first to tell you about another podcast we really been loving lately it's a new podcast from the folks at Science Friday and it's called undiscovered undiscovered is a show about science but it's really about the people who make science happened and about the left turns and false starts that they make a long way in each episode the hosts anime and off and Ella Fedor introduce you to the kinds of stories that scientists share when they get together for a few beers after work this week on and discovered the fight over science funding it gets personal after a US senator call to research a waste of taxpayer dollars Joe paddock went to Capitol Hill to prove to that senator just what her science is worth and have to say I'm a big fan of Philip attic science so check it out you can listen by subscribing to and discovered on iTunes stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts or you can visit them online at and discovered podcasts dot o RG and now on to the show the I went to see ads in The doll's House at the tenth row center fitting to my left doll to gradually into his lap some skinny blonde I didn't recognize and he know that like shoving them in his mouth this will the time I look at him in a micro do need to own the company or those available Auburn has all haha grabs the box from a skinny woman acts of Hanson's meats on the sheet anything that open water and so I took the conversation he says So what do you do that's Nancy Loveland and what does she do she builds nonprofits the way Donald Trump build skyscrapers organizations are huge tremendous big league stuff believe me when Nancy actually sat next to Trump in that theater she just launched her first non profit Dress for Success organization star is a clothing drive to help women on welfare dress for job interviews she collected ten suits pearls pumps you name it Nancy had piling up in a teeny apartment she did Trump might have a spare storage room somewhere in Israel state empire she started pitching and I talk about Dress for Success and How amazing it is and he says Oh really do enjoy it and I was like yes it's pretty amazing helping women move from overwork and he says really it's not boring I'm like No it's not boring so i said im so Anu and he's on the floor and I said Well what do you do I just haven't really read the bill during a build things and I said oh Gee like it to me like I gave her a bite and they're off to rocky start no matter Nancy keeps pushing and I call a friend and say You gotta give me the name of his personal assistant she said that Norma foreigner who was famously this isn't for decades and I go to blockbuster again this is a long time ago and I got a giant box of my dad and I get a cabin at the age of terror and I love adventure and I'm a twenty six lar and I look around it's all golden glass and mirrors little nightmares I see the skinny what are my before the theater and I wave my arms she comes over she's like the and are you doing here and I said Look I will give him a box of my dad's a week for the rest of his life if you can just find me like five hundred square feet of space because everything's in my apartment she says his bro look around I'm like I see times are rough and I shake her hand and say Okay well thank you so much to love this about Nancy she doesn't give up easily now again I'm not sure I'm bitten by that but I don't give up there so I'm doing like Fox Beck to see the next week I look over and the woman sitting next to me recognize her i say de Lis Smith a gossip columnist is a NICU with a story you may be used and I told the story and that Sunday she writes of the New York Post and a rather calm nationally and she tells on TV Monday morning I take the near post and I got a Trump Tower and I say security is held over for a the eleventh downstairs I go up and over for dinner says the U We saw A E Saudi thinks it's very funny we have nothing for the end of the story is I had the most beautiful rejection letter I've ever seen in my entire freaking life on Trump Tower gold embossed letterhead as I've said before T O I could scrape off at logo and make fillings for everyone I know that the logos like a court of it off the page beautiful beautiful telling me that he had no money and sorry best of luck was working on something that PS is now one hundred and twenty cities around the world so like you would have been a safe bet to be five hundred bucks instead I've got a story that I tell every where the story isn't simply you can take no for an answer anyone can do that and frankly if you get too pushy you're more likely to get a restraining order that an investor the real story is about the power of persistence and a good plan B or other plans but just consider Nancy's multi channel charm offensive plays jokes multiple boxes of Milk duds letters surprise visits and your gossip columns this is what we call grit and grit is every auction winners Trump card to have incredible talent at every position you look there are fires burning on the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> the the easy <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> idea what the <Music/Noise> day the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> this is massive scale Irene Hoffman co founder of LinkedIn investor Greylock and your host I believe success on foreigners need ideas money good timing and a hefty dose of luck but none of those matter if you don't have credit some people mistake with a sheer persistence charging up the same hill again and again that's not quite what I <Music/Noise> grit the sorta great you need to scale the business is less reliant on brute force is actually one part determination one part ingenuity and one part laziness yes laziness you want to conserve your energy you want to minimize friction and find the most effective most efficient way for him I actually have more grit if you treat your energy as a precious commodity so forget the tired cliche of running a marathon you want to be more like Indiana Jones some are salting under Blazers raising a few steps ahead <Music/Noise> and swinging or what do you reach a holy Grail but if you ask me Nancy Loveland is the entrepreneurial equivalent of an Indiana Jones I want to talk to her for this episode because she's a ten out of ten when it comes to grit and she also does her work in the not for profit sector which has even <Music/Noise> mines than the commercial world capital is harder to come by talent is harder to recruit and our overall society at least here in the US broadly rewards commercial people more <Music/Noise> Lord nonprofit people but first a word from our sponsor zip recruiter I also as a rule in every interview trying to talk like a Viking that's Ian Siegel CEO of zipper Carter and verbal Viking warrior at least when it comes to interviewing job applicants hear about what I mean bad <Music/Noise> I try to be as direct as possible to see how they respond when I am completely honest with them so if I ask you a question and you give me a bad answer I'll tell you I think that's a bad answer here's my reason <Music/Noise> and I will see how you react because honestly that's how I'm going to interact with you if we work together Ian will help you discover your inner Viking later in the show and if you're looking to hire fast gives IT recruiter try zip recruiter dot com slash scale the fish and so before we get our guests the entrepreneurs who put the Gar and the word grit I'd like to open a bit uncharacteristically with a quote from the Bible the race is not the swift nor the battle to the strong nor bread to the wise nor riches to the discerning nor favor to the skillful but time and chance happen to them all time and chance happens was all except Nancy Loveland time and chance don't happen in NC grr it happens and once this quality cakes n cheese unstoppable are thinking about some social problem she gets restless she can tolerate take for example are not for profit Dress for Success you recall she wanted to help women on welfare enter the workforce and style entertaining Lee Nancy never cared much for fashion if anything she finds it ludicrous my father growing up was a lawyer and his tummy when he was hiring secretaries who look out the window and watch them go from the car to the building and that he'd know before they reach the building whether or not hire them I thought was the worst thing I had ever heard I was like That's you just describe discrimination to me that's horrible and he said and it's the truth so go comb your hair and so I mean I knew that the world works this way we discriminate based on a first look on everybody and so that's where dress for success came from so Nancy is just identified a huge problem employers judge job applicants especially women based on the physical appearance she might have valiantly struggled for fair hiring practices that struggle for activists the sort of people who can tolerate any incremental battle with history and human nature but Nancy wants a solution now she can change the way the bosses think overnight but you can level the playing field by giving women access to professional clothing she has an idea is five thousand dollars in seed money from grandfather's estate and she's about to get her first unlikely collaborators and sorrows in law school I went to my law professors and hey I have this idea What do you think and he sent me to a sister Marion Ernie and Spanish Harlem and then she bought in to others you may wonder why Nancy's law professor Center to see nuns in Spanish Harlem about her idea for non profit Nancy had the same question when I went to meet them for first time I fully expected them to meet me in inhabit with locked arms singing like The Sound of Music the <Music/Noise> Instead the really cool they're like I like social workers the really cool women the drawback was I took financial advice from them they told me to put the five thousand dollars into a six month CD in the bank was owed no money so like don't take finance advice people take an oath of poverty is the last in the air bag whenever I have done a start up the first thing I actually do is call my family and friends as you think wow they love me and I love them that doesn't mean they love your idea I don't know during the at risk and the thing about the nuns as they knew tons about moving people from welfare to work they knew exactly what was going on in New York City and how to make this happen and how to get started they were actually the exact right people to start this so how did Nancy in three nuns manage the scale this network worldwide they didn't have much money aside from a five thousand dollars check from Nancy's great grandfather's estate they didn't have connections the wealthy philanthropist and it certainly didn't have staff their only asset was their knowledge of the welfare system that system including a vast network of government and private agencies dedicated to helping women Nancy simply build an organization that could tap into this Talent Network for Free Challenge originally was we have these people who are moving from welfare to work how do you get them into the system without passing a judgment on individuals and then how do we solve or labor problem in the shops we combined that we did was re screened agencies that approve domestic violence shelters we would improve job training programs would approve homeless shelters and then they could send whoever they want it to the shop as a barter require them to send someone to staff the shop one day a month so we got free labor and high quality referrals and didn't ever have to pass a judgment any individual to everybody who came to us was worth stressing because one of our employees essentially have referred them and by the way this model of staffing the shop and the referring stays today in over a hundred locations around the world knows what Nancy did not do she did not try to build an entire system from scratch by or self which is a trap many entrepreneurs fall into she looked around for other sources of energy the anti Jitsu artist she redirected the energy stronger heavier fighters and this way she channels the collective strength of the existing welfare system towards realizing this idea with or you can think of this technique is a magnificent shortcut it's the kind of shortcut Nancy finds again and again she darts ahead she finds quick systematic fixes the big gnarly problems at the patterns from her story of grit and the same quality that helped Nancy navigate the welfare system just as well as she walked away to New York's upper crust and others so in the early days of dress for success we would do these clothing drives so imma give us clothes so we would do a clothing drive like Goldman Sachs when they go corporate casual would get beautiful beautiful suits unlike the larger suit would be a size eight and they advertise American is actually fourteen and the average size Dress for Success client was a twenty two but we only did those youth anyway because once you gave us your Armani suits you give us money so we would take the suits we might warehouse them for two years but we were happy to get the suits from those women a Goldman because then they would write us checks because they felt closest to us because we had that suit that day like interviewed somebody and or that they you know like went on CNBC the first time they're wearing Armani suit now we had it and so it was actually kind of a donor mechanism it was part of the whole cycle of Dress for Success of like kind of wealthy business women connecting with women who are going to go out land their first jobs notice how she keeps turning problems in this case piles of useless clothing into solutions sources of funding that's why I call the best on her infinite learners the more thorny patches they hit the more effective they become at hacking their way out the only problem is that some CEOs like Nancy get a bit addicted to problem solving there's no promise of well they create some more time CEO once things get good and its peacetime I get bored I either wanna like do something else while to get up because I'm like No but we could do blah blah and so I get bored and move on this is one of the by products of grit it's a sort of restless energy that eventually compelled antsy to leave dress for success once it scaled and we talk about Scooby doo syndrome I talked with us in so you seen Scooby doo Scooby doo episode is the same there is a church or a movie to be torn down in strip mall day and there's like a zombie or ghost that on to him and so Mr ng is called in to find the zombie ago and shaggy and Scooby are somehow the ones that always find the summer goes in the Velma knew it the whole time which is totally weird but whatever and they unmasked as honest it's not a zombie or ghost it's like the granddaughter of the founder of the movie theater or like the janitor of the church it's the founder the founder is the zombie or ghost haunting the building it doesn't wanna leave I had no desire to be a Scooby doo villain right so I leave things I build things and then I'm up to the sentimental value watch a lot of the I mean c'mon I'm an eighties kid watched a lot of that so Nancy found a new problem nearly bankrupt organization called Do Something done or do something mobilize young people to volunteer for worthy causes back in two thousand and three he was nearly defunct what was a state of something when you back it was on fire and issue started when he was an honest place but then he went off air and had three kids in New Jersey and do something fell really hard times when I got there they had just laid off twenty one of twenty two people they had lost their office space and everything was in boxes in storage in Queens they were two hundred fifty k in debt and had about seventy four thousand dollars The bank is totally totally fine Nancy was smitten you know what the name is great do Something was great there was no organization that was cool and fun for young people and it was there need to be something that made volunteers and social change fun and energetic and so to me was like a face plant you know like leaves fall off all the time of the roots or the back and I thought was interesting I also just turned thirty and I was getting head hunted for a number of very serious roles but what I realize was that the header was only bringing in me to make the head hunter look good here's one crazy outside the box candidate look to review a thirty year old entrepreneur known as taking me seriously and I want to take something that was totally screwed and prove that actually young entrepreneur I'm also really smart thing sometimes honors are written off as wacky visionaries know we're we can be more than that our systems thinkers before long Nancy got that fight this plant flourishing the breakthrough moment when her team identified a crucial shift in technology that made all the difference in reaching the adolescent audience if you know a teenager you already know to get their attention text them I think poly the biggest epiphany was the pivot attacks and the best thing that I did was get out of the way so I was on a conference call and I saw her like a glass door people my office high fiving each other and I was like I didn't like was going on while so heavy and um and it turns out that to like entry level employees had pulled five hundred defunct users the people we hadn't heard from in six months to pull evil than twenty times and pull their mobile numbers and texted them about a campaign redone and nine minutes I saw a twenty percent response rate Holy crap I was smart enough to say let's do that and also I guess I was smart enough to create an environment where entry level employees feel comfortable experimenting and like that's what you've got to do as an entrepreneurial CEO is now the way sometimes and then when you see someone do something really smart rabbit and elevated be like Let's do that and so we pivot and we became a membership organization and we did everything around tax and grew rapidly thanks to Nancy's ability to tap every <Music/Noise> her including her entry level employees is one of the hidden strengths as a scale leader under Nancy's guides do something as nearly five million teenagers as members and then she does something truly dare she Hatch idea for a third non profit called Crisis text Line and she goes ahead launches at the same time I don't recommend having two full time jobs notice how Nancy doesn't relish holding down two impossibly demanding jobs at once but you have to understand the motivation when she sees a problem she wants all that fast the bigger the problem the gnarly of the solution the more she wants to solve it her irrepressible urge to launch Christ excellent begin with a single text from a single teenager you see do something said all this communications by text message and their volunteers respond by text as well each campaign would unleash a wave of goodwill and cheer for the most part but there always a few teens who applied to these texts asking for help but there be a couple dozen messages out of flow saying things like I'm being bullied my best rendition of A Samad and we were three oz them one day answer a text message that she couldn't stop turning over her head was in response to a Do Something campaign and then we got a message that put me on this other path that literally said he wants of raping me it's my dad told me not to tell anyone and the letters are you there imagine you're the CEO to the brink that the tide essence like I don't know what to do this I've been punched in the stomach it's over African leaders have it a real human and then how bad this have to be to share that to be so low that you share that with an organization like this interview don't know where this going and so the Crisis text Line really for her and she we come to the wellspring of grit you have to have a mission a calling it so powerful it makes <Music/Noise> through a minefield on a foggy day with your shoe laces tied together so Nancy and Asian Crisis text Line has a hotline that would funnel text messages to crisis centers around the country would open a whole new line of communication for the convenience and anonymity <Music/Noise> from the phones then she figured she could earmark some portion of Do something's budget for the cause they are averaging six million dollars a year in corporate sponsorships and I went to board when do you guys haven't the board that I want to do this and you rightly said brand confusion we do something do something is hopeful happy volunteers m Crazy Sex and the different thing to give it your buddy value to the side and so did the same time for a long time was harder than I thought it was going to be winners may be harder than it should've been the truth it took me two years to secure the funding to do it and I would dial for dollars and I found one friend that was like come into my office every week for an hour and viral attacks on the third week I spoke to someone and in five minutes I discovered five and said Stop stop stop I may give you fifty thousand dollars because someone needs to give you money to see if this will go nowhere and I may never see you again but it's worth putting aside down and I want to be anonymous so I referred him for a long time as Mr. ax is now fine being known it actually is Peter Blum has the border of donors choose who has done is he's made bets on people like that not expecting any return these early bets on social change ideas it's awesome and with that money became real I had to really do it I hired or CTO their chief data scientist even I only had fifty k so that was going to keep them very long and so then it meant I've really got to find the rest the money I make this happen so Nancy once again was scaling on a shoestring budget she figured Crisis text Line could piggyback on a patchwork of crisis hot lines across the country she would supply the text messages the counselors would supply the twenty four hour support shaping up to be another one of her clever just two moves until Nancy found she was channeling their energy to the wrong teens crisis counselors tend to specialize in specific issues like suicide or sexual abuse or eating disorders and this led some councilors tried some rather awkward scripted responses originally built this thinking we would just be the types we would be the technology and we would find this out to other crisis centers to do the counseling and we kept growing like fast SS we went from three to eleven and like six months crisis centers we noticed was that they were incredibly diverse won prizes enter would ask every single text or are you feeling suicidal today um no I have a calculus finals afternoon should I be feeling suicidal like the quality was all over the place was great so we called best practices from the platform and said well what we train our own people based on what we're seeing and so we trained this magic twelve cohort and quickly saw that they outperformed and every Cape yacht API stands for Key Performance indicator and did so he dumped of the crisis center so we were paying three save them money moved in said To volunteer model and basically become a marketplace Nancy has made a hugely risky decision here she's scrambling for funding she's just jealous and or partnerships with the experience counselors who are supposed to help or scale she is any chance of keeping idea flowed she is in our train an army of novices and the art of texting with the stress teens Nancy has a gift for bringing other people along on her hero's journey each user own grit to embolden inspire people to join or even do it for free in fact the greatest shortcut Nancy is ever found one she turns to again and again in her story of grit is the almost bottomless well of human industrious but Nancy understand so well is that people love to help sometimes all you need to do is ask let's take a quick break for our sponsor sip recruiter we're back with Ian Siegel CEO of zipper in shared one story from a job applicant who could make the most fearsome Viking employer go weak in the knees he said we gotta go find somebody can build the best possible mobile experience that we can and we interviewed a litany of really like a place Silicon Valley mobile expert talents and they all came and gave presentations on the features they would tell every one candidate who came n he said Here's a couple alike obvious ideas for mobile features let me say how are really going away and it was this comprehensive entrepreneurial approach filled with vigor and enthusiasm and it was clear that this was somebody who wanted to win in the category who didn't just want to build a cool product ready to channel your inner Viking post a job unzip recruiter hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate and twenty four hours you can try it for free zip recruiter dot com slash scale the TV show in the fifties so confident volunteers will answer call that envisions <Music/Noise> for Crisis hotline volunteers much in the way to build a marketplace for drivers already built a marketplace for home rentals but how on earth she match supply and demand she can offer surge pricing to volunteers during a spike in teenage need she can offer any pricing whatsoever what she needs is a surge of good well it's a bold vision and our handful of other scale leaders will tell you that this works I think as a rule we tend to underestimate people's hunger and desire to be helpful that's Greg Baldwin president of volunteer match their website matches millions of volunteers more than a hundred thousand organizations that need their help the most scalable nonprofits he says with a plea for help that ambitious verging on and reasonable when Habitat for Humanity got started how unreasonable is it to think that you can invite millions of people to help build homes for other people it's crazy I had when you think about it but it took somebody to ask to see how powerful that task is to bring people into doing something that they think is important Crisis text Line is another amazing example of it so unreasonable to think that people would willingly take time out of their busy lives to be on their cell phone texting with kids in crisis it almost doesn't make sense why someone would do that and certainly you can imagine being reluctant to ask somebody to do that but what we find so often is it in those big bold asks those under reasonable ask that some of the most amazing things happen for this episode we did a flash poll of the Volunteer Match community the managers and non profits when the front lines of these crazy requests we wanted to know just how hard they push the volunteers and how far was too far so we ask Have you ever heard of volunteers say you're asking too much of me more than four hundred volunteer managers responded and statistically speaking it was a <Music/Noise> no only eleven percent volunteer managers have ever heard that was as fascinating and then we asked whether they thought they could ask more of the volunteers and seventy percent of the users said yes so the real question is what's keeping people from making these requests that are somewhat outside the norm it's a good question and John Lee the former CIA Mozilla has a theory Brazil is an open source web browser powered almost entirely by volunteers do everything from coding to marketing to translation and John actually believes these volunteers working for free can run circles around paid professionals you just have to know how to work on a sliding scale there are ways you should get an hour we gt forty hours week or eighty hours a week and skills up and down which was just an oddity of the employee or not that sort of binary open source this pestilence figure weight of the spectrum there's a guy I remember from long before that if Arsenal are to much going for him he did it because he hadn't done that his parents who only spoke on going would have been able to understand software to access the internet for these people they do it is a labor of love and you'll know this the root of the word amateur is Amo lo I think the amateurs and volunteers in many ways <Music/Noise> powerful the professionals do it for non monetary despite all the challenges of our birds and Nancy is an expert whipping up that Hamas that her love she starts for the promise that she is not unique in carrying plenty of other people could care as much as her she just has to find them and sell them on her cause if you want to know a true grit sounds like just listen to a multifaceted approach to recruitment so recruitment

point the middle than I remember reading I wonder if when Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had hockey practice or the answer was no and this is not a good sign for what was a good sign was Brian's willingness to work with his hands burns and all I'd argue that painstaking hand crafted labor is actually the foundation of success in order to scale you have to do things that don't skip the

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> this is Mattias a scale Irene Hoffman co founder of LinkedIn partner Greylock and your host on this episode all make the case that the only way an organization can truly scale is the first two things that don't scale at all I'll try to prove that there are two stories from some of the smartest entrepreneurs I know over the last twenty years I've worked on or invested in many companies that scale to a hundred million users or more but here's the thing you don't start with a hundred million users you start with if you stop thinking big and start thinking small hand serving customers win them over one by one now this may sound like odd advice if you're an entrepreneur with global ambitions marks October didn't personally invite one point eight billion people to Facebook he built a great product and the uses just poured in right not exactly on this show all dispel that myth by talking the founders who fought to win their users but first a word from our sponsor zip recruiter in Seattle is the co founder and CEO of sap recruiter hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate and twenty four hours in says competition isn't other job listing sites the biggest competitor we face is the inertia of small business owners that's right tire business owners his toughest competitor is you making the decision to actually hire is a really difficult one because they look at it as I'm not sure what to write the job description is it really so difficult to post a job in doesn't think so stick around here more or try zip recruiter for free it's a precursor com slash scale that separate router dot com slash scale the Division I and I'm starting with Brian Chess key sealed or b and b because he epitomizes the idea of hand crafting the user experience before you start to scale it's a principle he first absorbed in design school I was doing medical design once I designed each of the ventilator I had to sit in the shoes the child and I had to like imagine being a child get unlike the operating table like you to put yourself in the shoes of a patient person use your product and if you're only doing TB test like never designing empathy but a funny thing happen to Brian when he moved to Silicon Valley he sorta forgot about designing with empathy for single user it's a common mistake among such matters with global ambitions have to promise investors the world tens of millions of customers billions <Music/Noise> it's intoxicating just listen to Brian go this is a troubling history as something like seven percent will be cheap between five and seven trillion dollars ten times the market size of people and Brian might have stayed in the stratosphere if not for a fateful meeting with Paul Graham co founder of Y common plant company there is a startup incubator which cultivates and in the early stage companies Brian was admitted to one commentator two thousand and nine and its first meeting with Paul was confounded Paul tells the stump people with deceptively simple question any after us where's your business we mean like with attraction will have a lot of track people must be using it I said there's a few people in New York using he said something on never forget he said to your users are New York and you're still unknown said yes we still doing here what you mean to go to your users know that your customers one by one and I said but that won't scale for huge remind customers of every customer he said that's exactly why she do it now because the only time you'll ever be smaller you can you tell your customers get to know them and make something directly for them Brian is co founders followed his advice to the letter we literally community knew recommend you so we would be in like um air for tonight dinner and then Wednesday I was good and you are literally would knock on the worse of all of our hosts had their addresses and say knock knock lo hei is Brian Joe or founders he's one of the It's a little creepy just a knock on the door unannounced we need excuse to get home so they came up with an offer that the host couldn't refuse we tend a professional photographer at your home and photographed are having money in the can of Play photographers to join I shut the door and how his company's pre small these home visits became heir be in the secret weapon it's how they learned what people loved it's really hard to get even ten people of anything but it's not hard if you spend time with them so I want to make something amazing to spend time with you and like what I did this what if I did this what I did this from those questions handcrafted experience is born find out hey Anelka couple to guess who they are looking at profiles rate we want to profile I want to photo great layouts one that we were with him to school okay at that stuff and then you literally start designing touch by touch point the creation of the peer review system customer support all these things came from us literally as mere use of a nice joke that when you buy an iPhone Steve Jobs incomes even a couch but I did it's was a particular experience has really stuck in your mind I remember we met with a couple host and it's winter it's snowing outside and were like in snow boots and we walk up to the apartment Miami went there to photograph the home and were like Hey I'll upload your photos to the website you have any other feedback he comes back with a book he's got like dozens of pages and it's in the end of creating a product roadmap for us like this this this this this and were like Oh my God is a road map as he is the customer I think that always stuck in our mind as the road now often exists in the minds of the users to design things for his typical to get very detailed feedback from some of your early users and if you're not getting some people who say this is super important I love this I really need this to work well it usually means rough track passionate feedback is a clue that your product really matters to someone and one passionate user can turn into many if you listen to them carefully it's essential get this kind of feedback early while you still defining the product it's like setting a foundation as an architect you wouldn't build a skyscraper before you've built a solid foundation user feedback ensures you won't build a dozen floors on an unstable swamp Brian has a simple method for extracting detail feedback from users he doesn't ask what the product he already built he asked about the product of the dreams we ask these questions that will reduce the price you like what we do not make this better to make you tell everyone about answers different if I say what I did make better decisions all our Savior what it takes for me to design something that you would literally kill every single person you ever start to ask these questions and it really helps you think through this problem is essential to seek out and listen the user feedback on the cob that is you have to figure out which users to listen to you can have different kinds of users giving you feedback and some of it will take you in the wrong direction you need to exercise judgment in discerning this particular user and particular feedback lead me to the mass market or is it an edge case for example it linked and we had one group of users who invent a name for themselves they call themselves lions which is linked in open network because their theory of the world was that everyone wants to directly connect everyone else because that's the way they want action not the majority case a lot of people were very busy with access resources of some celebrity status do not want that we follow their feedback Lincoln would not be where it is today we had to steer away from a bunch of passionate users who told us very explicitly that we were fools for not following their advice if you want to tell something is truly by royal decree a hole like my experience that you tell everyone about it so we basically took one part of a product in the strap with five star experience being in the trees so a one two or three stocks hits you get your BB and no one there to knock the door don't open the one star you know it may be a three start they don't open yet we never show up past your money back that's when you never use so I start Spirit as You knocking the door they open the door the light rain it's not a big deal until every friend about him I say used a BB or so we thought what a sick starts a six star experience knocking the door the host opens a read welcome my house to house and you would show them around in on the table would be a welcome gift to the a bottle wine be some candy for its water bath in the for the trees and the whole thing is great that's a six car and you say Wow I love this more than a hotel maid every week at work and I stuck with the seven starts up in the door opened it and welcome here's my full kitchen I know you like surfing is a surfboard waiting for you iPhone lessons for you it's going to be an amazing experience and by the way here's my card you can use my car and you know I also want to surprise you but I got you the best restaurant cities of Cisco I got you a table there were like whoa this is way beyond adding stars clearly excites Brian took some time to run through this mental exercise will skip ahead to the tenth our experience would attend church I can be a gender check and would be the Beatles check in and I can to get off the plane and the beef five thousand high school cheering my name with pars walking need to get to the front yard of the House and the oppressed and I would be just a mind toward eleven starts I would shut the airport in you be there with you on not using you don't think the <Music/Noise> play of the process is that maybe nine ten eleven are not feasible but if you go through the crazy exercise of keep going there some sweet spot between showed up in the open the door I went to space the sweet spot and you have to almost designed extreme to come backwards suddenly doesn't just like having like knowing my preference and having to surf porn house seem like not being able to kind of crazy logistically but this is the kind of stuff that creates great but how far you go with eleven star experience to create the Nevada product all success on trainers at some point have to come back down or there's really two stages of a start bought the first design a perfect experience and the new skill that and that's it but which part of the perfect experience do you scale to the most ambitious entrepreneurs let's call them the lawns after my friend Elon musk probably get there through brought energy because they're convinced they need to solve the problem and the un scalable thing is one step that they have to push through on the way the lawn say I'm going to mark the first to solve this problem for me first I need to get that rocket launched a need of a business model for the first rocket and that looks like satellites okay I'ma try satellite launches and how to get my first rocket I need to create a scalable rocket platform to get the first rocket up it doesn't matter and you kind of work back to that then you've got folks like Brian you say I realize that to get this awesome experience I have to ratchet back to something that still seems like magic but is totally doable and I need to design elements that get me into the totally doable thing how does Brian decide on the doable thing he said a lot of service with the appropriate level of magic and started building and use the next thing you notice they didn't launch perfectly scaled services they built everything by hand we had a saying that you would do everything by hand to a painful so join I would put at home so painful hours we managed with spreadsheets with Senator I don't think I knew how anything would grow to the level that it that that's really feel she's the intern who manage those veggies she still works there bein' be very manually I would email the photographer and the host and connect them and the photographer would then send me the photos I would go through each one giving feedback if they needed to be re touch and then I would manually upload them to the Post website listing one by one it would take hours to upload multitasking was the name of the game on me the tools to make her more efficient and we kind of look at this and we said OK what is the easiest thing that we can bother me any little thing that changed was quite a shift in what I'd been doing for the better I remember one day Brian would come to the everyday how many how many photos were shot and it was like okay I have to go through all of these and eventually a system that everything we built a system where now it hosts the press by an alert system which goes to a Dispatch photographers all manage through technology they get the job a market for a nap that we bill and payment happened the whole thing is I note how they gradually worked out a solution guess what users wanted they reacted to what users ask for and then they met the demand through piecemeal process and here we come to true art of doing things that don't scale it's not just a crude way of succeeding on a shoestring budget it also gives your team and the inspiration and urgency to build the features that users really want I've seen this hand crafting story play out over and over again with Aunt for us take my friend Patrick Collison he's the founding CEO stripe and online payments company today thousands of businesses use striped process payments from their online customers but the early days they were scrappy startup and Patrick paid close attention to as users very close attention we had a chat room for you just help customers with whatever issue they asked about very distressed or other notice that he who would commit to the chat room of her sleeping and asked question they would get a response and we wrote a bot that were just page one of us somebody asked a question they'd get a response after more than thirty seconds or something so with broccoli theory I'd wake up in my sleep so in addition to being CEO Patrick had become stripes bleary eyed customer service rep frustrated users would page him at all hours it sure did not feel glamorous this happened we have the upper half an hour in bed reminds me of an appalling Lou Shu fun to kayak kayak is an on line travel service that finds the lowest available rates across different websites we know that yet Paul for a number of years and Kai had his cell phone numbers the customer service we also had her do this let's try to do exactly the same day now it's common for entrepreneurs to swap stories like this I think it's worth dwelling on these early days of handcrafted work because most entrepreneurs tend to have a funny reaction of these experiences the ME laugh about it later they make all the work on glamorous me celebrate the day they could hire a helping hand or automate these tours out of existence but thoughtful founders will never say what a complete waste of time often look back on this period as one of most creative phases of their careers Nancy Loveland for instance scrap Ali launched an international nonprofit from our New York City apartment her organization Dress for Success started as a clothing drive for women who needed to walk into a job interview looking sharp and feeling confident Nancy stockpile sweaters on her bed and jewelry in refrigerator and soon she was inviting volunteers into our apartment for informal training sessions so people are hearing about dress for success and would contact me just random people would contact me if I were starters and they Louis to start this in Hartford and I was a great day with me people literally strangers would fly from sailors and stand my futon my college futon in my tiny like law school apartment in New York and I kept my help and I would send them postcards like saying like Don't give up I know it's really hard you got this I just killed them with kindness today Dress for Success has affiliates hundred and forty five cities worldwide let's be clear the transition from handcrafted phase to the massive scale Phase is a challenging one and I want to dispel any illusions that you can switch from one to the other with ease in fact it requires two opposing mindsets you have to fully empathize with a single user at the same time you have to worry about everyone I like the way that Brian describes the difference the designing of experience is a different party brain that is killing your spirits it's a different skill set the skill and experience highly analytical operations oriented colleges aren't a problem the designing of experience as a more intuition based human and pathetic and an experience one parallel might be writing editing handcrafted phase tends to be more like writing more inventive and creative process was this killing phase tends to be more analytical it's more like being an editor at that point you to do more pruning you realize well this whole thing is magical but if we focus on this twenty percent we get eighty percent of the magic so you prune too compact to distill a new architect so can now run a rocket ship or a transition the product or service over to a scale organization that can now run it the organization needs a simple plan with very few errors and very little improvisation more in a moment after this word from our sponsor zipper we've been talking with is a recruiter CEO Ian Siegel about the pain of posting a job listing online in ticks off all of the pain points I got to put this ad out there and I'm not sure what site to put it on I think I wait like thirty days to get candidates then I got to figure out how med vet these candidates and interview them and get somebody in here no part of that sounds fun as a busy entrepreneur Ian sympathize is he wants you to know that the recruiter offers relief for critter you don't have to ask the question Where should I post this job you literally post and we put it everywhere and it takes what use to be a process that required a month or more and it can turn it into something that can literally be done in a couple of days and once you've experienced that once you discover that hiring can be something that can be done efficiently I think you are more open to the idea of future hiring Ian will share his own hiring rule later in the show you can try zip recruiter now for free at sip recruiter dot com slash Schell the TV show and now you might think the first step design the ideal user experience drops away as soon as your product goes viral then comes the glamorous work of expanding in new countries and think about your strategy in the years ahead handcrafted work is essentially a kind of booster rocket that helps you get in orbit but it's not the kind of rocket for the whole trajectory get you out of the gravity well and after that get ready to slingshot around the world became international company then melted as eleven we raise money with billion our valuation company in the summer two thousand eleven will miss home that trash and then we headed to the next step which was We are just as little cubby apartment but this was real concerned with the China office building you better be grown ups we had to build twenty percent supporter had to have more secure payment instruments we had at the City team to verify people's identity we realize it again in my transmission licenses so then there's this whole like administrative bureaucracy that gets added then two dozen twelve to the point here we have like fifteen hundred employees we have no executive team is no management company meetings there's no communication so no one knows anything out like literally nothing I mean how we read The Company Institute the basic things like have an executive team and the lawsuits come and you have to really sorted out unfortunately we're not regulate federal level regularly at the city level and every city is different in the ICU in Paris here in New York were different see the city by city you've got to hire those people really treat these issues can be of use lay a dragon complete the board gave me the next level and all the sudden the track really going to slaying dragons it's hard to hold on to the handcrafted mindset still I would argue that the sharpest founders never fully abandon the mindset no matter how big the company and so the organization will start having antibodies against new handcrafted things it's a response that protects organizational efficiency it says look this new thing we can get to scale it won't operational eyes it won't fit within our process the reason the scale companies have a hard time with his handcrafted process is all in the list of objections about why this won't work why they should be integrated as part of the company and so you need to do is a Founder's be extremely joyful about which hand crafted innovation you choose and how you protect the organization you need to protect it because a natural reaction of the scale organization will be to kill it he wanted to reinvent the industry again and he knew he had more to learn about the travel experience and wanted to do it so he turned Hollywood for help I often find that to be in the industry got tickets patient directly from that you need to look at what other industries for us your title industry travel with cinema and the best you've ever seen are the trips that characters in movies half that we would buy that analogy and realize actually literally hired a storyboard Artist Pixar and we had in store for the extent we did that we realized it was like this to our movie and only twenty minutes in the home the result is like leading up to the home getting the airport going around dinner hang out with friends out about like most the trip was not home but we realise that point we need to be in the end and business travel so the same way that things don't scale we call the magical traps decided let's find one chopper create the perfect trip for them notice how quickly Brian turns attention to a single traveler in an instant he switches from global concerns back to his art is no roots the and that's because he's building something radically new here who wants to scale the perfect trip but what is the perfect room the what are the essential ingredients to make a vacation truly memorable the question Brian can't even begin to answer it really delivers that experience to at least one person the are about to get a master class in hand crafted and so we put up the flyer not of the things seeking a child where will photograph your chip December Cisco if you let it fall you this guy Ricardo replied From London studio and we sent a photographer around him while he was just having the services go what we learn with his triple off like each show off Alcatraz Fi and cellphone headset me go to Bubba Gump shrimp it stay in like like budget hotels he got a hotel bar by myself like sitting like that much due to the bar hopping with very weak on that chart we want to create the perfect distance to fly him back in we had the team storyboard the perfect experience very good driver picking up the airport and took the perfect gear you need the service is on the dinner parties got the best restaurant we took them is Midnight Mystery bike or sixty riders go on and nobody delivered both land and its like there was this crazy magical world I see him again the chat see how research at the beach was amazing and then I walk away goals Ryan one more thing and he starts the time he takes time to thank you is best for a while <Music/Noise> oh my god I guess it worked like it really moved me to never try to like design and and experiences to me like they're in a movie before we did that became a blueprint and we said We're confident un scalable basis that we know how to create a trip that deeply move somebody in anything that expands the question is can we develop a technology skill to do on the notice here how quickly Brian switches back to the analytic minds can extrapolate from a single journey to a list of essential ingredients here's a systematic breakdown of the perfect trip universal CITY The Walkman and twenty four forty eight hours we're around people when you land at MIT that id two or three you'd have a challenge at your comfort so if you do not leave your comfort sound not remember the trip and if you can belong out here for sound and something new happens to you then this can be a moment of transformation for the person you were in a small way die in a new better version yourself now this is the narrative of every movie ever seen a main character starts or narrow door because Special to the new magical world where all these obstacles happen and the overcome some of the call to her ouster in the I guess that wraps up a small team and we spent the last couple years figuring how to scale and this has led to what we have today which ships in November of two dozen sixteen brine unveiled five hundred packages and twelve cities and now he's fully in the scaling mindset figure out how to expand service to new destinations but as Brian will tell you he misses the handcrafted work is a surprising message for entrepreneurs who have only a handful of users to serve I kind of tell all the action I miss those guesses exciting attraction"

reply all my favorite new podcast I can tell you that masters a skill we're big fans as well go subscribe to podcasts or stature and if you'd like a list of the best episodes go to reply all limo slash start here and now onto our show next October famously launched Facebook as an undergraduate student at Harvard but to understand the origins of the success I suggest going back the way back when I was eleven or twelve years old or useless little games for myself to start off by making a terrible game it's like a scam I remember the snow on the snowball with my sisters the graphics were literally stick figures but I could get my sisters to play because they prefer playing the game actually have a snowball fight outside where we grew up in New York a lot of tech entrepreneurs tell stories about the basic games they built as a kid but what sets market part is that his story just keeps going and going my dad as a dentist I have my growing up one of the neat things was that his dental office was actually connected to our home the dentists n hi Janice needed to share data on the patience and shadow so I built a system where he could communicate with folks across rooms I can also communicate with me and my sisters up stairs but I call it sucked that the <Music/Noise> guys can you hold that effect we get to Facebook because it was basically our little network inside Zuckerberg home and it was fun is this guy was the predecessor to the budget if social softer ideas that I remember very early on very early on the way on semester ever sees that noticed that some actually beat a well to mark as a teenage hacker he was already moving faster than the industry giants hitting care of his product was perfect he just wanted to get out there and I actually wish more entrepreneurs have the same carefree spirit of a teenage mark because when it comes to launching a product imperfect is perfect the incredible talent at every position you look there are fires burning in the the the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> this is matches the scale I'm Reid Hoffman co founder of linked In and partner Greylock on this episode I'm going to make the case for embarrassing yourself as an entrepreneur in fact if you're not embarrassed by your first product released you released it too late the Y because your assumptions about what users want are never exactly right easy test a real product with real customers as soon as possible basically the moment you have a bare bones version is the fastest way to build something users can't resist to show your work early show it off and above all don't hole up in your garage and try to perfect your product on your own you'll be wasting your time more fatally you'll be wasting your opportunity for Steve Jobs you can wait for your product to be perfect but they're almost no Steve Jobs in the world the way for most entrepreneurs to create a great product is through a tight feedback loop with real customers using a real product don't fear imperfections they won't make or break your company what will make or break you with speed how quickly you'll build things that users actually love my friend Mark Zuckerberg is the perfect person to talk to about this has no qualms about rushing out an imperfect product in fact his famous mantra is move fast and break things and I'd argue that it's the foundation of Facebook Success markers but anything it's making sure his team moves with the sweetness of a teen hacker releasing products that are anything but perfect so the audience can improve them I think the strategy of Facebook is to learn as quickly as possible what our community wants us to do and that requires a culture that encourages people to try things and test things and fail but how to get Facebook seventeen thousand plus employees to shed their perfectionist reeks you're about to find out but first a word from our sponsor ship recruiter if you write a job ad that sounds like it would be great for guys from a frat you're going to predominately gay guys that's Ian Siegel co founder and CEO of zip recruiter hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate within twenty four hours in steam noticed that some job listings attracted more guys than gals so the commission to study with a deep dive to see if there were key words in the job descriptions that we can correlate with a higher incidence of females applying <Music/Noise> incidence of males applying and we found a lot of correlation we found a lot they're finding word choice matters stay tuned to hear which words matter most our listeners can tries a recruiter for free it's a precursor com slash scale the new star Mark Story when he was an undergraduate at Harvard by this time he was in the habit of slapping the other programs on the fly he couldn't help himself to his classroom of Augustus the <Music/Noise> and the final exam was around to show some piece of art from the Augusta in period in Rome and yet to write an essay on the historical significance and I was actually putting the first version of Facebook when I should've been studying for that couple days before the exam as Adam custard this isn't something like math reading to show up in gratitude problem on the exam i take action to know the context of this race a contract is SS wait a second rewind this isn't something like math we could just show up and figure out how to do the problem on the exam who does that in any case with the exam fast approaching you might expect Mark to cut back on the coating instead he doubled down on a bill this service where basically anyone in the scat <Music/Noise> a piece of art and you could type in whatever context you thought was important enough to show you everything that everyone else in the class said but it was a study tool but can crowd sourced exactly what people needed to know for each piece of art professor ended up telling me after that that the grades on the final were higher than it ever been before and I had a passing that cost you <Music/Noise> for a moment what would've happened if Mark was a little less hacker and a little more perfectionist what he took his time to get the random piece of our program just so it might look nicer might have more features but he would have missed the opportunity to put in from his classmates when they needed it and more importantly would have missed the learning how they used but many of us and I'm guessing most of Mark's Harvard classmates have a tough time rushing things out cheating people have a tendency to be perfectionist and the same instincts that make us good students can make is lousy on where is Susan Danzig or has a great analogy for why <Music/Noise> hard she's the CEO's video platform for recording and getting high quality videos online and here's how she thinks about factions problem what you wanted to start up this kind of released a draft paper and the one that you're sort of embarrassed for the teacher to read and rate the money you would never actually hand and then we have to de program myself to say that we actually believe things that we are just like slightly embarrassed about this we see is not the slightest bit embarrassed about releasing programs he slung together on a moment's notice in fact he relishes it most of those programs had a pragmatic purpose an urgent reason why people give them a try like a fast approaching final an ancient art that many news programs also serve a social experiments he was always fascinated by what interested people and what interested them other people you know what I was getting started at Harvard I was really interested in the idea of how people can come together <Music/Noise> to create an understanding of things that they couldn't do separately that so I built a lot of different tools in my time at Harvard about this thing course match which being the term you try to figure out what classes you should take an obviously download the course catalog made some things that you could say what courses you are interested in taking and you can just click through the classes it's a quiz in them and who is thinking of taking it was all texts are unfortunate in that fascinating but people just spend hours browsing this people just have such a thirst for understanding what's going on with people around them in their community that even something as simple as just understand context around what courses someone to take in a taping of really interesting thing much more than you'd think notice how user <Music/Noise> change the way Mark thinks gives him a new lens what people want to do online their interest in the most mundane details of other people's lives consistently out strips market expectations what do you think about all the start what courses you taking your peers want to know each time our case Lee builds and releases a new social tool and added more evidence to theories held since childhood the Internet changes the way we socialize I've always been very interesting how people communicate I am part of a first generation of folks really grew up with computers and the Internet and it did shape a lot of my childhood even beyond suck that every one of the interesting form of memories that I have of using computers and thinking about communicating with computers was I went to the school that was the next town over us every day I would take a bus over this bridge to get to school and at the end of the day I took a bus ride home in all my friends of ghosts of the bridge so in order to communicate with them I was basically it would not have cell phones back then so I was communicating on the AOL instant Messenger and things like that and we did all the subtle signaling around no way messages and status updates that you'd have an idle times and just all these all these different things and I just say gripping very attuned to although the nuance and the need for people to control how they were communicating about themselves and the signals that they're sending and the importance and how effectively you could communicate and keep in touch with people even if they were on the other side of a bridge to your whole social communities every day when what our new home so that that definitely I think Save A Lot My Philosophy products that we've now built around messaging especially how that'd work market building and testing tools for online communities and the communities kept springing up faster and louder than he ever imagined so we picked up the pace packing release and hacking and release among his coding projects there was a photo Mashpee created as a prank and then there was Facebook <Music/Noise> as an aside about earmark make a passing reference to the film The Social Network or the movie as he calls it considers it a work of pure fiction with only one exception I done this prank Face mash which was one of the only true things covered in the movie it was not really a predecessor to facebook anymore than any of these other things were put away was this prank thing I did was okay could you produce this common understanding of who people of the school thought was the most attractive it's not something I'm very proud of now is not my best moment in the mean spirit and I would do it now but there's another one of these tools asteroid belt in which these things are in the Harvard Crimson was like How could someone go build these things in a few days yet it's going to take the student government two years to build an online Facebook ok that's the case I can pull the stuff together and make it so there's a utility that people can understand what's going on with all the students around them of their school and we can pull this together in a few weeks so it so that was kind of the yearly thing I just wanted it to exist at Harvard and I was just really interesting this idea of how you could pull communities together to produce collective understandings around things and one to use it for myself so fell to Harvard and scaled it from there Mark didn't invent the concept of a social network and well established competitors in the For Myspace and friendster and he didn't consider himself in their league it may sound hard to believe now but Mark assumed Facebook would go the way of suck net then he was just a tune and hacking away at a student project you're building the first version of Facebook obviously think at that time this is a global social platform what was your first thought and building Facebook I did think that someone was going to build a global social platform I just thought that there's no chance of going to us it wasn't even like I thought about it was like oh maybe it'll be us probably not it was just so it was even a question asked of course it wasn't in the US there are these companies out there that know how to build the stuff and we were in a company frighten a figure that somewhere the world people are doing the real thing I was just messing around in my computer science classes and I realize that we actually got started with and kept going at a Hey this actually was the real thing you keep on sailing and growing I've heard this refrain I didn't know would be us time time again success has a funny way of sneaking up on the best on spinners they devote themselves to understanding and serving a teeny cohort of users they don't always recognize that this intimate link is precisely what enables a product of all for the mass market that's one reason I encourage entrepreneurs to release a product earlier than they'd like release observe react over and over again it isn't just about speed and it certainly isn't about sloppiness but rather precise stands between Facebook's tiny team and its growing use of the uses normally take the lead but not always sometimes Mark had to break the choreography and give the users a world that's because you have to discern what users actually want Mark received an early education in the gap between what users say and what they do particularly as he expanded the social network two new campuses <Music/Noise> within this funny dynamic where you talk to how we started at Harvard and we'd launch at Yale and then all people are like aw come on like them and added that sacred at every stop along the way yelling you want to plumb the other people yelling of relieve those guys it's the word Indiana University in Indiana state law says and people Indiana University come on I'll just say we were use to this dynamic of people assuming that change there is like why are you doing this but then coming around pretty quickly notice the lesson Mark is learning here he's learning <Music/Noise> listen each college said they didn't want another college to join and then as each new college joined the network got stronger and people liked it more this a great example of how entrepreneurs need to both listen to what users say and selectively ignore the people can't always accurately predict their own taste or even their own interests for example a baseline for Facebook is the other people are going to upload pictures about other people are going to attack them and when those other people tag them your friends are all going to see them possibly before you do you want that product yesterday most people describe that was the product what the product to get everyone super happy with the proper people systematically a very poor at predicting their own reactions to new things Eva's Mark became a savvy forecaster of what users want from Facebook he still didn't think he was building a business more in a moment after this word from our sponsors if were were back within Siegel CEO of the recruiter who was surprised to find that certain words used in a job listing tipped the gender balance of job applicants can you give a few example of the words that surprised you if you use understanding or affectionate and a job description you'll attract more <Music/Noise> if you use the terms leader aggressive ambitious you'll definitely a attract more <Music/Noise> but I'm wondering when you say it can really impact how many women would apply to a job like how great can that impact be when we did the study companies that were using what we consider to be gender neutral wording we're getting as much as forty two percent more candidates than employers who are using gender biased terms stay tuned to hear how eons thirteen year old daughter reacts to these findings and goes up or critter dot com slash scale for free trial that's a precursor dot com slash scale the room at the end of a second year at Harvard in two thousand and four he is co founders left for summer break so what brought you to Silicon Valley so I didn't mean to move out here I'd been at Harvard for my freshman year and the summer between freshman sophomore year in and software's wanna start Facebook and Dustin like co founder of Facebook and I wanted to get out of Cambridge for the summers are like where should we go to work on Facebook the car let's go to Silicon Valley that's this mystical place where all these companies come from and I remember we explicitly talked about one day we might start a company and this was after we'd started Facebook so if the the clear implication was one day we're going to credit company but this was obviously not the company that weren't created by the end of sophomore year I think there are about twenty eight or thirty schools that would spread to because literally towards writing in from school saying hey we get this our school so we just ran schools by how many requests we had four in them we never had enough server capacity just launch of school that had the most request us about wanting it and we moved out here for the summer expecting to go back to school in the fall we had our first run investment that Peter Steele led Peter teal is the cofounder of PayPal and <Music/Noise> investor in face and you participated and were grateful for that and I'm glad that I worked out well for all of us but I remember we told Peter we go back to school the ball and he clearly just didn't believe us right so he was right we were wrong come fall we realize that is just too much work to scale up to hundreds of schools at that point while doing a full course load so to take time off search the car will take a turn off and then that kind of discontent continued is an understatement to give you a sense of how quickly Facebook took off we asked Hall of Fame sportscaster and podcast or Dick Stockton to offer the play by play Facebook's growth over the next few years its two thousand and five Facebook expands to two thousand colleges they can't get enough by two thousand and six sock turns down a billion dollar buyout later that year the genius programmer get some fifteen billion dollars off per diem the <Music/Noise> two thousand and eight his hacker target Internet Titan with France Charles Sam Bird One <Music/Noise> baseball has been profitable the opposition seems on the double by two thousand and twelve B takes place the blame I haven't seen a run and gun team like this since the coats the Denver Nuggets by two thousand and fifteen based book clubs and one billion active users <Music/Noise> one of all gay if you're a fan of Dick Stockton you may be interested to know that he has a podcast of zone it's called Stockton with an exclamation point underlying all of Facebook's early achievements was a consistent philosophy practiced everyday by its employees move fast and break things this monster was plastered all over Facebook's headquarters its core belief is to release products early when they can still embarrass you in a raid upon them quickly in response to what you learn from your customers do users love it they hated the worst of all to ignore it maybe the product breaks under certain conditions maybe its embrace by certain segments of your community and rejected by others but <Music/Noise> maybe they use it but for different purpose than you're expecting wow the only <Music/Noise> lessons is with real users in real settings I think when you're building Internet software that you can change every day there's really something to the strategy of just learning go as quickly as you can even if not every single releases perfect think you're going to be doing better over a year or two then you would be if you just waited to get feedback for your of all your ideals if that's really for having more than any single product that we're working on at this point that focus on learning quickly is the strategy of the comp this philosophy was born in the tech industry but plenty of leaders apply these under additional methods to more traditional industries takecare golden she's the founder and CEO of water I ninety <Music/Noise> beverage company that sells water infused with fruit flavors personally I love the cucumber main Chara put this idea into practice we reached out to her to learn how she thinks about releasing imperfect products ones that people drink she starts off by debunking the idea that your product has to be perfect the number of entrepreneurs that I talked to that our holding pattern because they think that something needs to be perfect prior to bringing it to market is astonishing frankly if you're not okay with flying the planes are building it and if that really makes you uncomfortable when you get frozen and you really can't is and you're in trouble China Bull decision <Music/Noise> to add sugar or preservatives to her bottle drinks first is meant to drink when bad really quickly but she still wanted to know if people like the flavor so she started selling bottles of hand even if she was scouring the world for the ingredients that might extend shelf life we're really watching our product carefully and making sure that it is profiled in chains and again we knew that it only had a few weeks shelf life we're constantly watching it the next or that for example it in caramel which in a non preserved products current Ohio is known for her that expecially if you don't think that your product is perfect you think it's parade then and he was actually figure out if it's going to get some sort of reception the essence or just get out there and you can always improve it along the way it's important to distinguish between the digital world and the physical world as we like to say in Silicon Valley the world bits and the world of atoms because the world a bit is much more malleable and easy to fact or atoms are much more expensive but every entrepreneur must walk this fine line between fixable in fatal the important thing is that you push or experimentation to the limit for Mark and his growing team in Facebook the Montrose move fast and break things serve <Music/Noise> cry and the floss him a lot of sense when their fledgling startup beli of thousands of employees moving fast and breaking things someone has to clean up their messes as Facebook grew Mark became aware of a growing tension between his hack read those to move fast and his responsibility as CEO to avoid breaking things on such massive scale does a new mantra was born move fast with stable infrastructure well it's less catchy but the best Montrose do more than just sound good to give you the resolve to make tough decisions to move fast I think is interesting because you actually have to be willing to give something up to get it and the question is What are you willing to give up and early on that raid was move fast and break things the idea was we will tolerate some amount of bugs and flaws in the service of moving faster in learning what our community wants faster we got to a point where it was taking us more time to go back and fix the bugs issues that were creating than the speed that we were gaining by going faster we need a new strategy to enable us to move fast and we came up with was going to do this by building the best infrastructure so an engineer comes from any company has been built a ship their product faster here and tested veteran move faster in all these things at Facebook than anywhere else and we're so that's what we mean by move fast and stable infrastructure but again we'll get for free we invest huge amount in building infrastructure seventies values always come down to what are you willing to give up to get something because it's not free nothing is more concedes that move fast with stable infrastructure is a clunky Montrose it doesn't have the snappy appeal of move fast and break things but as guard rails to protect the company and its new phase you can still really something bold and hot bait you can still break things just don't break the infrastructure because the infrastructure is too slow to repair and if you break the infrastructure it will ultimately slow you down and with that new <Music/Noise> Mark lay the groundwork for mass experimentation on Facebook how does it work exactly one thing you should know about Facebook it has many faces that even point in time there's just one version of Facebook running are probably ten thousand any engineer the company can basically decide that they want to test something serve some rolls on sensitive things but in general an engineer can to something and they can launch a version of Facebook not to the whole community but maybe to ten thousand or fifty thousand people whatever is necessary to get a good test of experience and then get a read out of how that affected all of the different metrics in things that we care about how are people connecting with people sharing people have more friends in this version right of course business metrics like how does this cost efficiency of running the service and revenue remaking it can even kick of qualitative study is ask people how happy they are with with this version of Hindu that the engineer can come to their manager and say Hey here's what I built these are the results we want to explore this further and do this and giving people the tools to be able to go get that data without having to argue whether their ideas good through layers of management before testing something frees people up to move quicker if the thing doesn't work then we add that to our documentation of all the lessons that we've learned over time it does work then we can incorporate the small changes into the base of what Facebook is that now everyone else who's trying to build improve and that's the new baseline that they need to get against and here's the thing to really give your employees the freedom to experiment you have to get comfortable with embarrassment I asked Sheryl Sandberg Facebook's chief operating officer to tell the story of a legendary embarrassment that's now part of company lor we have a wife a famous story of a spat about a young summer intern and you want to help figure out how we cannot take the site and to understand how we recover from August or so he traded but the site are for like thirty minutes and you know in our industry that is crazy and he got hired full time love the Lord and they started calling what he did and pass the the So we put things in place that didn't take the site down but he was the celebration of that was a good idea well executed but we still wanted to those tests I think being pretty open about where we make mistakes Mark does it I do I think this takes all the time this willingness to hazard mistakes isn't just liberating for Facebook's employees it enables mark to focus on the things that matter creates this mode of running the company where what I kind of do as I figure out what the high level directions I think we should go in our best people to work on those things but then on the day to day basis a lot of the decisions that are making are like OK is this going to destroy the company because if not then Mike let them test it right in its cost of the test is going to be super high then in general we're gna learn a lot more by experimenting and by letting the teams go explore the things that they think are worth exploring than by having heavy and with that in mind I want to amend my theory I do believe if you're not embarrassed by your first product release you release to tooling should add your feeling embarrassment won't dissipate in the second billed for the third in fact will continue even if you scale the product to more <Music/Noise> most innovative products to be a perpetual cause of embarrassment the word embarrassment plays a key role here over the years some people have interpreted my theory as permission to cut corners act recklessly or proceed without a clear plan but notice I said if you're not embarrassed by your product I didn't <Music/Noise>"
"33","Masters of Scale","Innovation Managed Chaos MIX 10.mp3","we'll get a Masters of scale in a moment but first a pop quiz did you know North Dakota was not a state until two thousand while it's

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> This is matches the scale I'm Reid Hoffman co founder of Lincoln Harbor Greylock and your host in this episode I'm going to make the case the best managers of the most innovative organizations don't tell their employees how to innovate they manage the chaos prove that to you with stories from some of the smartest entrepreneurs that I know let's take a quick break for our sponsor sip recruiter I asked Ian Siegel CEO of sap recruiter how he defines the zipper critters company culture culture he says comes from within I definitely think that Parker is a reflection of who I am personally in and the views that I would espouse as to how a company culture should operate but I also think it comes from the stories you tell not every story he shares has a happy ending you can really tell the people who enjoy the startup story and you can really tell the people who get filled with anxiety when they hear about particularly the low moments how low will even go stick around to find out go to zip recruiter dot com slash scale for free trial that slippery critter dot com slash scale the TV show and if you want an innovative company your job is to

re invent something as spectacular order of magnitude you have to suppress management let your employees pursue wild <Music/Noise> that may raise your eyebrows is not for you to judge whether their ideas are good or bad it's for your employees to prove it through freewheeling experimentation I want to talk to Eric Schmidt about this because he pushes the anti management philosophy to its outer limits as CEO of Google and now as chairman of the parent company Alpha that he's an unlikely proponent of chaos because he came to Google a company that nearly crashed due to lax management before Google he was the CEO of a software company Novell will start the story in his first at Novell when he discovered the company's financials weren't all that they were cracked up to be reality of course here on the first day as I was presented with different numbers for revenue for the quarter than I've been told I was interviewing and by that Wednesday Thursday and Job were in a real crisis the month which he called the worst month where everything was fail the clearer the business was in very different animal there was <Music/Noise> that month I remember saying to my colleague the I just want to get out of here with my integrity intact there's only one way to take your mind off the disaster of the scale flirt with scary or disasters my friend said you needed distraction and if you're flying planes you won't be able to think of anything else best advice ever she peered at him a big difference shockingly to me is an aviation they teach you to make rapid decisions and they over and over again decide decide decide it's better to make a decision and just accept the consequences and that discipline helped me in the hard times I was in a villain a real hardcore turn around so I approached aviation the same way I approach the company was trying to figure out actually worked when she figured out it's a well defined system has a certain logic of a certain beauty and once they noticed two things in the story the first of the way Eric thinks about companies that a well defined system has a certain logic to nature beauty of the things of the company as a system that he has to understand the other thing I watch and notice what flying taught him about decision making in aviation a teaching to make rapid decisions made over and over again the side to side it's better to make a decision to just accept both of these habits will serve as well as he lands in Google's cached exist and he's about to land that opportunity came in the form of a fateful phone call <Music/Noise> a call from Jon Dore good friend and venture capitalists who said he should come over and talk to Google though Sister search engine will enjoy it and I said probably not the but I figured I'd go visit because I'm curious <Music/Noise> I walked in and here's Larry and Sergey Larry Page and Sergey Brin <Music/Noise> of Google too young that I had my bio all <Music/Noise> and had food on the table in front of us that this is very on and they proceeded to spend an hour and <Music/Noise> grilling meat like the bitter about what I was doing at Novell and decided <Music/Noise> the products we were building made no sense I of course provided a blistering counterattack as I left that day I realize that I hadn't had such a good conversation here's <Music/Noise> That was the moment I knew this was a special company <Music/Noise> you might find a dog here a blistering counterattack described as a good conversation but I'm not surprised Eric's reaction here he knew how rare it was as an executive to find a team that's willing to challenge you and this feisty free thinking team just might push into the top of his talent not every SEO is cut out for this kind of insubordination but the most innovative ones welcome it I asked Margaret happen to give us a perspective on this market was the CEO five tech companies and she gave a Ted Talk called dare to disagree so I thought she might have an opinion on Eric's reaction any CEO worth their soul is starved for argument and debate so I'm not incredibly surprised by Schmidt's response because one of the big problems with power is that most people won't argue with you if you're in a powerful position they mostly try to second guess you try to figure out what is it you want me to say and of course that's no use at all because being told what you think you want to hear doesn't give you any options UConn of stock in your own had you have to be able to butt heads but there's an art to disagreeing with high speed high AQ conversations often have the rhythm of point counterpoint that's how you move across the intellectual space quickly I say something and you say well actually this part of what you're saying isn't quite right here's the better version some people naturally excel at this kind of conversation for others it takes practice technical people for example usually need to learn you don't have to start the conversation with you wrong on or that's the stupidest idea ever heard far better you can say That's interesting challenge the point of view if you do that way you frequently make more progress because then people are less hung up whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong and stay focused on the idea as Eric ventured outside the executive suite he found idea generating conversations unfold across the company I think a fair statement is that the founders built the company in the image of what the sides Stanford grad school so the offices for example if you had them would have four people and which is the number of Addison's her office and of course everyone's very crowded it's very casual courses free food habits or hang out all day and that gratitude and culture that sense that somehow we're about to discover something new permeated the decision making they were able to invent some new ideas so the culture of food and benefits and the quirky came from the founders trying to recreate that feeling amid this creative ferment his job was simple he just had to give employees a slight nudge to deliver on their promising ideas the first thing I did as I went to the staff meeting and the staff meetings were long <Music/Noise> they were like being in graduate school what do you think of this when you think of that but a real lack of business procedures in that kind of thing which were easily remedied when you struggle by bright young minds you don't have to push too hard for interesting ideas they tend to tumble out of conversations or share challenges and take you in unpredictable directions but not every manager's comfortable with this type of chaos cause a particular kind of leader who can embrace both humility uncomfortable notion that you don't <Music/Noise> best ideas yourself and uncertainty because you can always schedule innovation on a predictable time to come right out of your control free going to <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> uh the the <Music/Noise> that you find yourself relating to some it's Jimmy land heart by the way you're probably at least heart control freak and the hardest part for control freaks is when your team suggests an idea that you find utterly reckless and that's exactly what Eric thought when his team suggested a radical new way to set prices and advertisements let's take a quick break for our sponsor sip recruiter we're back with Ian Siegel CEO of the picker and a fan of scary stories he insists that if you want to find applicants that thrive in the startup culture don't just sell them on your company's high points go lo you know I tell this we had as many startups do we had an idea for a way to enhance our product that a lot of people in the company got excited about so many people got excited in fact that up to thirty of our very best talent peeled off from our core products to go work on this new initiative and after a year of thirty people working on it and a multimillion dollar investment I shut it down and then suddenly thirty of our very best people were filled with anxiety because they no longer had a clear role inside the organization and what sort of reaction do you want to see from a candidate after you say something like Ian will share the best reactions and the worst later in the show for now you can try zip recruiter for free go to zip recruiter dot com slash scale to turbo charge your talent on that slippery critter dot com slash scale the is she the one about described may sound crazy to you and it sounded that way dare to Eric's team in an argument fight type of auction which bidders name their price without seeing competing offers the highest bidder wins but only has to pay the second highest bid this is effective because it allows bidders to go high knowing they will only pay true market value and there are plenty of academic papers explaining why this type of auction would actually work wonders on revenue companies rarely put into practice I was absolutely convinced that this would bankrupt the company and I was so convinced that I ordered a hash restriction period were the only thing that you could do was spend money on Friday mornings at ten am to my office and you had to convince me that you needed to buy those pencils are those computers or whatever you are the right is not only was he convinced was a bad idea he was convinced it would bankrupt the company so he forced all purchases to be brought into his office in person and as we push this thing through we turned it on we had no data Analytics because no one had bothered to get that working at When into full crisis mode for a week meeting everyday at four clock to try to figure out what to do at the end of the week will as we were making far more money and we were able to go wth it was that moment that I realize that both steam was magical but also that the scale of the search ads opportunity was immensely larger than even we have noticed how Erica stunned by the success that emerge out of this county because it magical and harnesses magic in organization you have to understand where ideas come from not just from individuals but from networks of people and this runs contrary to popular myth about innovation we tend to tell the heroic story of innovation is a story that credits a single inventor the founder of the creative route by the genius has an idea everyone else acts cute on it and then everyone waits in the genes have another but that's a false story of innovation and breaks at least two s first was true that some people are much better idea generation others it's always better to have a number of people working idea simultaneously the best idea may come from Person Number eighty nine and you can't always predict where the good ideas will come true and second very rarely <Music/Noise> spring perfectly formed like Athena from the brows is to turn a good instinct into a good idea to talk to a lot of smart people and asking for feedback and criticism for having networks both within and outside the company to improve ideas is key to success Margaret Hepburn and former CEO five companies an advocate of frank conversations has a great example of the time this worked Aster to tell the story piece of software we are running had a very specific problem which was what I would call a load balancing problem we just require too much processing power and the more customers we call them more acute problem became and because it's such an existential threat everybody knows about it and one Friday one of my marking people came to me and just said you know I'm not an engineer but I just had this idea I call in my CTO and say Harry is about this and he thinks about it for me the things I think I know how we could do that so it was a really thrilling not to mention kind of life saving moment but what I think is especially interesting is in very silent organizations or fear for organizations you would share that problem but actually everyone knowing the problem was what allowed us to solar market is right no one in your organization has a monopoly on good ideas particularly when you've hired thousands more creatives what's equally important to recognize as a leader is that you personally are not the source of all good ideas my friend Mark Pincus learn this the hard way he's co founder of the gaming company Zynga which pioneered the idea of blending games in the social media before Zynga he built one of the first social networks a little known website called tried that didn't quite make it past him tell me that story it's pretty amazing if you think about it that I started one of the first three social networks in two thousand and three and I managed to fail that time when everything worked I actually managed to fail and the lesson from tried that came resoundingly <Music/Noise> for me and still stand out I like to say is that as entrepreneurs part of the journey that we're on is learning how to separate our winning instincts are losing ideas I think is a rule of thumb if you're good on where you can assume that your instincts are right ninety five percent of time and your ideas might be right twenty five percent on time Mark launched and was acutely aware of the dangers of stubbornly sticking to his idea is try to draw the distinction between is usually great instincts and is not always great ideas I'll try anything and I'll kill anything I'll kill it quickly and not to let killing idea of killing instinct that was a really poor idea that I'm still thinking about and learning as an entrepreneur and I can see it playing out still often people's companies mark separate specific ideas which must be killed when they don't work from underlying instincts and this willingness to kill ideas is essential to Making Innovation Work freewheeling idea generating climate of open inquiry like the one Schmidt cultivated Google has to be mashed with discipline and decision making in order to thrive most unwilling to do is to have quick decisions and you'll make some mistakes but the decision making we ultimately adopted a model the staff and Monday a meeting on Wednesday a public meeting on Friday and this is organized so that people could travel and the agenda was everybody <Music/Noise> meeting the decisions were made and so is long as you could wait a week you knew you'd get a hearing I feel I cannot tell you how many people told me that Google decisions are made today quickly almost every case even our current scale and that's the legacy of that decision most large corporations have too many lawyers to me this is makers unclear owners and things she'll like occur very slowly but some of the greatest things happened very quickly we made the decision to purchase YouTube and about ten days by incredibly historic decision because ready or focused we had a word meaning want to give it up so I always tell people somebody is running your company what are they doing what they just make this decision even if it's the wrong decision of quick decision is better than almost every case this combination of inventive bottom of ideas and focused top down decision making has guided Google's growth over the past sixteen years the two forces don't always live together comfortably Eric took some radical steps to keep ideas flowing within the organization this means empowering engineers and keeping management check for instance product leaders can draw in as many engineers as they'd like on any given project so long as they can convince engineers to join a team I've talked to other managers a Google or frustrate with this because they argue we agree that my project is strategic why don't you just the signs of Engineers to me an answer is No you have to persuade the engineers that your projects a good one to work on that and then by the way you have all of <Music/Noise> that you can persuade to work on that project and that's central to Google's culture for making progress Eric took this idea one step further He grant employees the freedom not only the shoes of projects but openly defined their managers along the way Google famously instituted a rule that any employee could devote twenty percent of the workweek any project they'd like twenty percent time was in some ways a logical extension of Google's graduate school culture managers like research advisors can set timetables and budgets for experimentation but the staff likes tunes pick the research agenda many many initiatives in the company have come out of twenty percent time ideas of the mapping work many of the search ideas many advertising many of now the AI were come from people working and practicing various desserts as many of the products people know best email Google Maps Google News has since brought up ideas generated by employees during this twenty percent on why exactly does it work and while the rule says you can do anything you want to get twenty percent time these people are computer scientists and engineers are not going to veer too far away from their core business and that is the genius of points the tendency of high performing employees to use or twenty percent time productively is the well documented genius of the program but there's also a hidden genius of twenty percent time allows reasonable employees to define unreasonable <Music/Noise> and this institutionalized defiance can help balance the power and keep high performing employees engaged during challenging times the interesting thing about twenty percent times although it's reported as you get to spend one day doing whatever <Music/Noise> really serve that was a check and balance on the power of the engineering management over the subject so if an employee is under pressure manager says you've got to work harder you've got to give me everything you have that employed him legitimate look that boss in the eye and say I'll give you one hundred percent of my eighty percent and that's simple principle would never really happens in practice it's understood empowers the employee with both dignity but also some choices was there anything you regretted that came out twenty percent I know because twenty percent time was understood as likely to fail part of your compensation was your ability to try new ideas and fail the value of that failure is incalculable because you tried something it didn't work when you try something else into her persistence doesn't mean marching on the same program against the same hill with the same sledgehammer whatever metaphor you want persistence means you keep trying to change your tactics modify your strategy you think differently about how solve the problem and you don't cross the so step one manager mechanic process <Music/Noise> is allowing <Music/Noise> that flow freely <Music/Noise> step two is making quick decisions on what's working what isn't but step three is even harder citing the precise moment the <Music/Noise> the world this requires an explosive change of pace as soon as Eric saw the potential of Google's new advertising model the one driven by auction pricing he turned to his friend Aimee course Tawny and asked about global sales turns out international sales or nonexistent Eric saw an opportunity and he acted and so I said he'd go to Europe next week and don't come back until <Music/Noise> European office said no and he looked again he said really I said yes it was very clear to him that look we need to fire the course on E who's now executive chairman of Twitter he told us what he was thinking of the time I get on a plane in the office they interview people and operations of London your ass on a Sunday night California alone I literally started going to tell them you know setting up meetings in hotel rooms and happy to my network a lot of these recruiters but it was initially little with the name of a loving and another that we hire the <Music/Noise> operation identified heads are Paris and the Hummer operations so a very productive week to either rule exciting that we're in the company and now the new wings across the globe today Europe is fifty or sixty percent of the prophets hundred billion dollar corporation think about if we waited <Music/Noise> how much smaller than the Wii so moving and establishing global revenue source quickly is key and in hindsight I would do that over again and I would've done it even faster knowing when the scale is perhaps the single most valuable decision a manager can make because Eric was practicing making fast inform decisions he was ready when the time came I want to offer a note of caution here I would never advise entrepreneurs to blindly copy Google's rules announced the teams ok we all get free meals twenty percent time and the freedom to care about the CEO's office now start innovating that's not a recipe for managed chaos so much is plain old chaos as Eric said you have to see organization is a complex system that operates by logic and beauty of its own you have to understand how your staff operates a network and you'll never build this network simply by announcing playful rules of the first recruit the right people who tend to swap ideas and tackle challenges together to effectively manage the chaos to hire people who thrive under chaotic circumstances remember how most people feel the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> and here we come to another secretive Google success they managed to quadruple in size each year while ensuring that every last hire was in Smith's terms a smart creative to the company was again very large very quickly and I had suggested to Larry in Syria that it was a problem with what I call glue people and blue people are very nice people who sit between functions and hope I decide that don't themselves out a lot of value and I thought these are nice people we don't really need them we can have the scripts talk directly and Larry looked at me and says we could solve this problem if you just review all the hiring of settler we can't look at all the higher the weekend so the company of course is that a number of hiring algorithms which are useful in DC today many of them include pretty aggressive hiring interviews from peers asking people to do work and so forth ultimately the judgment has a lot to do with the person is interesting and so we would for example take a position <Music/Noise> rocket scientists because rocket scientists are inherently interesting and sales we love to hire Olympians or Super Bowl winners in football players because the discipline that they had in their lives as young people men and women to get to that point indicated that extra set of display I want to acknowledge that most companies don't have the option of hiring rocket scientist Olympic athletes and Super Bowl winners but there does have more pragmatic advice for companies that can set the bar and Himalayan heights today I would suggest that and this is since been confirmed by many studies"

found herself squaring off against the PowerPoint to do this <Music/Noise> not as vocal you might call them the silent majority in a few months later I was getting ready to can stage the global sales

seasonal everyone wants to talk about PowerPoint PowerPoint me she said you know the no PowerPoint it's very hard to claim he's the PowerPoint and said What no PowerPoint thing for clients and I

could speak up their great uses a power point and they're bad use of PowerPoint I'd rather focus your attention on how Cheryl handled it she doesn't just want to be heard she wants to be challenged she's not afraid to be wrong she's not afraid to change course and that's what makes a great leader and scale great leaders of fast moving organizations don't just make plans they break they have incredible talent at every position you look there are fires burning in the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> this is matches the scale I mean Hoffman co founder of Lincoln and partner Greylock on this episode of Masters of scale I'm going to test one of my theories on leadership are the kind of leadership you need <Music/Noise> that's changing fast so fast that the office you leave at night is different from the one you walk into the next morning I believe to lead an organization a scale to be as skilled at breaking plans as you aren't making everyday there are new competitors new threats new opportunities there's no simple straightforward set of marching orders it's more like a dog fight you a new team will be flying upside down an angle sometimes Cheryl is one of those gifted leaders has made daring decisions at every level of scale she can run a team of four or four hundred or forty thousand I wanted to talk to her about leading a company as it scales because she is literally the archetype for this kind of leader you'll frequently <Music/Noise> like me say the founders we need to find you your Sheryl Sandberg it's funny because if you would found <Music/Noise> at the beginning of her career she probably would have turned you down the main thing I was raised with his Don't go into business and to be a doctor my father's a doctor I have two siblings are both doctors wanted a married a doctor being a doctor was good it was giving back working in nonprofits or the government was considered very good business was a little suspect I started my career working at the World Bank work and leprosy in India AIDS in India blindness in India if you ask me today I graduated college I would ever work in private sector I would excite you and something so Cheryl started out in the public sector she spent seven years at U S Treasury Department as chief of staff to Secretary Larry Summers in that position she rubbed shoulders with the aristocracy of American business CEOs from every industry in late nineteen nineties she start to notice a certain type of executive who challenged all of her preconceptions the Treasury autonomous people wore suits but not Eric Schmidt Eric Schmidt was CEO of Google from two thousand one to two thousand eleven he's now executive chairman of alphabet Google's parent company now he he he he looked in culture Jerry Yang would come in Jerry Yang was the founder of Yahoo Yahoo days they look they felt different and it really felt like they had this energy and passion around changing the world and I remember this one day I was at Larry Summers and we had <Music/Noise> it was you know all the thinkers and everyone was wearing suits was very formal and then we flew across the country and Eric Schmidt picked us up in his car wearing jeans <Music/Noise> took us to a local pizza place with Jerry at and we sat there and they were talking and eating everyone's eating off each other's plates and a stark contrast between those two meals the formality and there but felt very traditional about the world I was living in and be in formality and the big ideas that were discussed at the tenor of what seemed like a new world convince me that for profit companies actually permission based mathematical show took the job at Google in two thousand one and moved to Silicon Valley title was business unit general manager which sounds important incidentally Google didn't <Music/Noise> units to manage I remember my first week Eric was busy and a working I think York for the engineering department at the end of the week with the rear was the reward was every single engineer would report directly to when Rosie was the VP ventures about two hundred engineers that was the re org or call report directly to him <Music/Noise> it was a crazy thing Saint two hundred ish people should support directly one person was saying we don't want management <Music/Noise> that was exactly what they were saying it so it was unorthodox <Music/Noise> and cool and had property that we really trust their employees to do the right thing I learned it was different from the Treasury Department right away right away one minute three minute three it's fundamentally not a good idea to have two hundred engineers report to one manager among other things you want your engineers to feel like someone's paying attention to them I'm sure show could name all the reasons not to do this but her credit she doesn't change us to the strangely amorphous team her third minute on the job and that's the reaction time she'll need because Cheryl is about to learn what every leader of a fast growing startup knows every plan is made to be broken she was four people were very worried we're going to growl so my first day I said Don't worry we're all can interview after the whole two weeks later the team's twelve people I was completely unreasonable to have personhood of people plus million tall people steal any works of everyone interviewed everyone that didn't work out so this promise I had made to make them feel good about scaling I took away a week past the scale always unfortunately include some broken promises as Cheryl would soon find out everything from interviews office space changes as you grow even a small take back can matter to a team another silly example that I don't think it's silly birthdays we celebrated Avery's birthday that day and then it came at me eventually we had a huge sheet cake with quarterly birthdays my team was four thousand when I left and everyone's names on the eye hey I <Music/Noise> know it sounds like it when a president because he started out and we celebrated everyone's birthday and we took that away that was a problem now not seen the mean don't celebrate birthdays seem to figure out weaker systems are going to look like leader and do it now I want to note a crucial distinction when it came to hiring new employees Cheryl failed to anticipate how quickly her plan what about the case of birthday parties she did she work out a solution she kicks in I hope that's the key leading to scalp you can stop the onslaught of challenges but you can identify the moment where they force you to pivot and start buying bigger kicks as the team doubles and triples in size a skilled manager keeps a vigilant watch for systems that are failing <Music/Noise> but the best managers they don't spot the changes on their own thirteen surfaces problems for them the trick is getting him to speak up when she was growing I interviewed everyone who joined globally aware that a hundred people I noticed that the queue for my interview was that kind of holding up our hiring process so I said a meeting with my direct report I think maybe I should stop interviewing fully expecting that they would jump right in and say absolutely not you're a great interviewer We need your personal recommendation and anyone on your team with a death ray of Light in the US myself I succumb the math n u din tell me and that's on me notice what Cheryl focus on here she isn't bothered <Music/Noise> applauded <Music/Noise> to step aside she's disturbed by the fact that no one told the truth she knows he needs everyone's honest input to make the frequent fast decisions Google's business demands and that kind of openness doesn't happen on its own leaders have to embrace truth of the especially when they learned that they are the problem I thought my interview was an important step I was their boss I was their manager if they didn't tell me that was on me and I realize I make it safer now to speak up when I'm messing up one thing you should know about Cheryl she basically build Google's engine for growth her team powered AdWords they ran the business that displays ads next to search results it may not sound like a thrilling breakthrough in fact it became the lifeblood the capital that funds nearly all of Google's innovations in essence Cheryl or team rebuilding infrastructure for global online advertising the pressure to scale was immense as a teen swelled from dozens to hundreds she learned the lead in a fast changing environment one essential skill as we've seen is to spot unsustainable systems but there's a second skill that Cheryl would learn how to hire people for roles that never existed before she learned about this when she interviewed for a role like that when I was interviewing for jobs at a really nice experience with Meg Whitman I was interviewing eBay Meg Whitman as CEO of Hewlett Packard in the former CEO of the day when I got to see her I just added to any relevant experience and she said no one has any experience because no one's ever done this before I really took that lesson to heart I did not go look for people with on line ad sales experience to good use because there was no <Music/Noise> sales experience to show <Music/Noise> people for roles Google had never existed anywhere before she also had to hire <Music/Noise> what you need just a few weeks or months changing organizations changing needs can be hard to predict just how long lead a given skill set and that's one of the hardest challenges of managing through scale as Bill Gates who you might have heard of how he wishes he'd handle hiring in the early days he shared some wistful advice you to call your younger self and tell yourself like OK here are some principles by which you should hire differently well with that phone call to yourself be well I was young i always tired the new organization would grow lot but the notion that these intelligences were a specialized as they are I was so wrong I thought partly because of myself or misperception to myself Hey I can learn sales is that you know profit loss tea you know the sales is cos need go this is something so I didn't have enough respect for different knowledge I didn't have enough respect for good management really good management is Brian founders listen carefully you have to start swapping out what I call general Asst those jacks all trades with specialist experience executives know how to lead massive teams I've seen company swap upwards of a third of their managers in eighteen months let me tell you those are not easy conversations I have with people who fought alongside you in the trenches let's take a quick break for our sponsor ship or crew were back within Siegel CEO of the precursor the hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate within twenty four hours if you're waiting months to hire a qualified applicant the problem might be you here's how zip recruiter gives you a reality check because we are so large when you post a job any specific geography and zipper critter actually have a pretty good sense of how many candidates are out there looking for work like that and I can match the keywords in their resume to the keywords in your job description and I can know things like the very best candidate you're going to get in that market right now is only a seventy five percent match for the requirements you just put into your job description but no but no job site tells you that it's an interesting it's an interesting possibility for the future stick around for a

going to be the right person in eighteen months or twenty four months is your growing and I'm not sure I always need those right decisions by those are decisions you to keep revisiting because you had

situations where we sort of hired some guy who couldn't get their hands dirty and then it was very frustrating eighteen or twenty four months if it made a pile on so I think there's this question which I feel like I don't also have the answer to but is bouncing hiring people who can get the job done now <Music/Noise> hiring the people who will also be successful with this balancing act between who you need now and who you'll need later is no small feat in the early star of stage you need all rounders who love to get their hands dirty later on you need polish managers know how to delegate not everyone makes it through every company turn not everyone is destined to be a manager some people are best as individual contributors as an engineer not as a VP of Engineering the key to keeping a happy team as you scale is to give your employees a frame to understand what's going on you need to give each employee multiple ways to tell their own story of hero Dom so they consider themselves <Music/Noise> either major contributor I mattered I mean the executive but I'm making progress in my career because it reflects a story that people tell themselves as well and the first product manager some of the head of product from the time were five people in a garage until become a ten thousand person company and that's actually pretty unlikely shows Tina Google was about to grow from four to four thousand she had to hire for uncertainty being ready to make and break plans and she had to hire fast that I really quickly so we started a temp to hire program we just hire people is tense and then we would evaluate them over the course of the first month to month and then we would convert the most successful of them to full time the was a great way to scale in those very early days when <Music/Noise> of work done very quickly it also costs to hire people we probably would have otherwise not how people didn't necessarily interview well people who didn't necessarily have the right background he was always looking for they came in to great work hiring temps is a great hack when you need to hire quickly but not every company can rely on hiring temps and there's also tension in every growing company between hiring fast and hiring well others have different philosophies on which to emphasize and when my friend Mike Cassidy has some rules around this which I ask to share <Music/Noise> he's now launching his bid technology startup Apollo fusion I want to tell you the secret sauce of his new company but I can is in stealth mode and he's hiring quickly but not hastily there's a limit he says how fast you should go me count the hours in the day that you're looking at resumes and doing interviews on the people I mean it's hard if you've got sixty one the company probably only <Music/Noise> six people three months and then another twelve people that really is challenging and what are <Music/Noise> are rules <Music/Noise> the early hire one of them is a bad hire first fifteen field the company so really watch out for those that eggs have a whole set of interview questions and techniques that I really <Music/Noise> trying to determine someone's team fire versus <Music/Noise> ice the other person's going to stop them Mike Cassidy isn't the only founder who puts a premium on each early hire Mark Zuckerberg the CEO of Facebook tells me he believes in setting the highest possible standard for each role so the single most important thing is to get the best people you can around you and what I look at my friends who are running other good company is the single biggest difference I see and whether the companies end up becoming really great in reaching their potential or just pretty good is whether they're comfortable and really self confident enough to have people who are stronger than them around and I've adopted this hiring rule which is that you should never hire someone to work for you unless you would work for them in an alternate universe which is me that you should give them your job if the tables were turned and you are looking for job would you be comfortable working for this person and I basically think that the answer that is no then your doing something expedient by hiring them but you're not doing as well as you can on that for all these things that Cheryl for example it's much stronger than me at and that makes me better and make Facebook better I'm not afraid or threatened by that I value that and that's what makes this good so there are times higher fast and there are times are slow in two thousand eight Mark began a very slow professional courtship of Sheryl Sandberg by this time Cheryl had scaled Google's online sales team to more than four thousand employees collectively they brought in two thirds of Google's revenue this fact wasn't lost on Mark when he first met Cheryl at a friend's Christmas party and Mark also made a fast impression I met Mark and I was just inspired I had been using Facebook I saw its potential to make us who we were putting yourself in your picture in your real friends in real connection real birthday on mine was such a big leap but was on it really resonated for me because it enabled us to have personal connections and so I believed in the mission and I just really believed in March he had energy and passion and a vision he said everything's going to be social sounds obvious now nothing was special but how do you bring in a senior executive of shells caliber patiently Mark knew he couldn't reverse the engine on this hire he had to get right the first time to say I had multiple conversations with Mark is kind of the understatement of his late night Diane come into the office particularly early Savior come over for dinner like eight and had clearly taken out at like eleven or twelve and knew we had to nurse once has weak for months I think way earlier and he decided he wanted to work with me I decided I wanted to work with him it was easy to have six hours a week time I did have of analysts conversation but he was right because by the time we work together we really talked about kind of who we were what we believed in what we thought the potential was a Facebook to scale how we would scout we also got the world's best advice for my husband gave <Music/Noise> guy didn't agree on a lot of subsidies the point and it was a dark and you know that you never well they <Music/Noise> said what you want for markets process agreement on how you work visa because even if you work all the questions you have that now may change though I'd like to take a moment to reflect on Charles awesome husband David Goldberg whose death in May two thousand fifteen came as such a shock to everyone who knew him he was the <Music/Noise> Monkey a generous mentor this piece of ice just one of the ways that he lives on <Music/Noise> we agree that together we agreed we would always do the first meeting a week and Monday and the last meeting of the weekend Friday I asked him for feedback he made mutual we always give each other feedback every week and it will be nine <Music/Noise> next month <Music/Noise> notice how Sharon Mark take disagreements as a constant feature of their working relationship if Mark and Cheryl had made promises to each other around specific solutions to specific challenges facing Facebook at the time it would have an Evelyn broken those commitments by promising they would always be frank and work through disagreements that was a promise that they have kept a promise that sustains a relationship to this day and under Penn's their company culture to be intentional if you're going to encourage debate and there's no one better to talk about this dynamic market for former CEO of five companies she gave a Ted Talk called dare to disagree she offers a simple advice to leaders show don't tell I constructed conflict is essential to our organizations thing you know one of the huge problems of running any kind of organization is how can you create an environment where people feel it's really safe to do that whether allowed to do and where people have if you like the robust this or maturity not to take it or make it personal Cheryl too believes this focus on respectful disagreement and fast feedback is what makes Facebook resilient as a company to be on the resilience we knew resilience as individuals and the way you build a resilient organization is you learn from failure the the you don't hide it you embrace at the So what if that means you have to get real feedback for yourself for each other you have to be open to feedback you have to ask for feedback you have to build in a culture where when I think you need to do something better you think I need to do something better we tell each other and tell each other directly and work out you have to embrace organizational failure us to sit down in deep grief when things go wrong why did they go wrong what can we learn what can we do better it's organizations that hide things under the rug that don't create a resilient because they learn this willingness to acknowledge failure to embrace this agreement is a critical advantage and a fast moving industry because allows <Music/Noise> mistakes earlier so you can know what to tear down and what to build up thoughtful scale leaders thrive on disagreement because it gives them the information they need to test our ideas before they make and break plans indeed they seek out colleagues who won't share their point of view and a lesson everyone talks about but I really mean as you really do want to hire people who are better than you are and who are different than you are short of that diversity right I don't just mean racial national age gender all that diversity is super important I mean efficient at how good of diversity which you get from others by principle such as personality covers the you know if you are a white male who likes to curl and Cy Fi movies probably don't want your whole team to either I think that David Fisher David Fischer I have worked together at Treasury at Google and Facebook personality types were just very different I'm much more up and down I will get nervous some things not moving fast enough I will be exuberant and I will be damn it if David is absolutely calm and overtake its of working together that balance has really been important because sometimes all it could even say this is an emergency I'll say no it's natural calm them and sometimes I'll say David you're moving fast enough and I'll say right more can I have that too we are very different right we are separated by obviously gender fifteen years he's my boss is fifteen years younger completely different personalities completely different working styles and I think that served Facebook Well you can't overestimate this kind of diversity you have to have colleagues who offer homes here chaos with the occasional breaks on your speed and it's fortunate that Sharon Mark bounds each other out because they would soon face one of the trick is transitions in Facebook's history an existential threat requiring a rapid change of course <Music/Noise> we have a word for these kinds of evasive maneuvers here in Silicon Valley <Music/Noise> we called it a hoot that's a fighter pilot <Music/Noise> stands for observe Orient decide Act <Music/Noise> the fighter pilot was the fastest to live with <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the other one <Music/Noise> to ever watch the movie Top Gun will have a basic understanding of how it works Tom Cruise's character maverick has a few bad guys understand a split second he or in some self to the enemy's formation they decide to form a crazy aerial maneuver the ax <Music/Noise> confound everyone score one for the free world now I'm not suggesting the tech executives secretly want to blast each other out of this God what they do want is to form slightly crazy super fast maneuvers again and again often hear founders asking What is the little loop of an organization or individual because speed matters in combat and also in fast moving industries and two thousand and twelve Facebook had to form the mother <Music/Noise> its users are migrating from desktop computers to mobile devices at a startling rate Cheryl and Mark faced a tough decision our products are designed for the desktop and we realize enable transition is happening is happening way faster than we thought and kept out stripping our protections and to mark this company on hands which he still doesn't wants to reset or mixture on the right path instead the company on and instead worry a mobile first company and he did incredibly well then you know happened next A I think people still came in with their desktop screenshots because that's what they knew had built and so a couple meetings in March you said you know what no more beatings unless your mobile screen shots first and chess play me can match after he made the shift in company and we really had to force that and the company really got on board but it meant retraining <Music/Noise> so shift on the scale tends to make your board <Music/Noise> a bit antsy Mark Zuckerberg share the concerns but the greater risk in his view was to take only half hearted step towards a new market so we made one really important strategy decision which was often when companies need to take two years or so to rewrite the whole app or software for you"

<Music/Noise> this is matches the scale I'm Reid Hoffman partner Greylock co founder of LinkedIn and your host on this episode to make the case that as an entrepreneur you need to raise more money than you think you need and potentially a lot more the prove that theory through conversations with some of the smartest people that I so why should you raise more money than you think you need one word Disneyland Marin FTC did not imagine that you spend over fifty thousand dollars buying a domain name from a five year old she certainly didn't imagine she'd have to sweeten the deal with tickets to Disney that life is unfair or if you look at a typical startups budget and sort the line items by sheer strangeness how many expenditures would fall outside the limits of your imagination more than you think you have to plan paradoxically for the unknown and that's the first reason you should raise more money than you think you need more reasons and you'll hear them in the story of my friend Marian feasts Mary has weathered booms and busts she's one of those where entrepreneurs who succeeded to the first sock combo and the second Internet way the story is a pretty convincing case for grabbing as much capital as you can while you can but first a word from our sponsor zip recruiter for the first year I took ninety nine percent of all customer support phone calls and emails from our customers and I really had no boundaries whatsoever that's Ian Siegel co founder and CEO of zip recruiter hiring site where eighty percent of jobs get a qualified candidate and twenty four hours but in the first year they needed to do some hiring themselves Ian doubled as the customer service rep I was on a first name basis with probably the first thousand users of zipper critter ins advice will hear later in the show for now just know that masters the skill listeners can try zip recruiter for free go to zip recruiter dot com slash scale the division and will start with the first company Eve dot CA which back then sold cosmetics online it was the height of the combo I open my door that you've got calm and we had literally orders coming in that very day like say watching orders pile in for cosmetics and all kinds of cosmetics that we did the weights on lightly color cosmetic things you think you might catch trap just success immediately the immediate success at twenty we were able to raise twenty six million dollars in first year so we did a very fast healing of the company went from zero to twenty people in six months I think we'd hire the entire put the cot C suite executives within six months can you believe that the entire executive who overnight in six months so Mariam was describing her and said exactly MY had three emotions all in one bundle panic calm acceptance panic from the viewpoint of Oh my gosh that's going to be a trainwreck home because it really is going to end I did something similar but of course I did that with all people I knew and acceptance because of classic part of the entrepreneurial journey here is being in permanent data you have to be always a work in progress in trading and in nineteen ninety eight everyone was a work in progress most Silicon Valley startups are spending and hiring a blistering pace meant exactly what any sensible offer would have done she raise much money she could she move fast she went all in I think the thing was that the market was so heated and so many VC for backing competitors in the space they have to raise was good that we raise that much and got out ahead of everyone because we ended up in the number one spot and five center back beauty companies launched in after us we were running TV ads it was him complete a land grab Marion called a land grab she was right everyone use that language land grab and even gold rush and that kind of heated market you have to raise a lot of money because the competitors are raising a lot of money after all you're trying to win it's easy to err on the side of caution to raise less and spend less but as a potential more risk in being conservative you might think your best serving your investors by being efficient with capital is possible but that's actually not true you wore Jer investors by creating a successful company and raising only twenty million dollars might mean losing the twenty million your competitors out spend you know marry him raise twenty six million dollars and kept are one step ahead of her competitors she could've raised even more she would have but is there such a thing as raising too much money personally I don't think so let's hear from someone who does my friend Selena to the koala co founder Eve night an online invitation service run the same time that Mary unfounded Eve dot com Selena went on to serve as president of Survey Monkey and is now founder of the new startup geek so as to reflect on the money she raised her Eve we took it way too much capital we took thirty seven dollars and four on line petition think it sounds crazy it was great picnic at the time I was all about get the eyeballs for the but word on when a line like it was spend the capital higher higher and the thing I've learned make sure you have a strong business and then scale it out make sure you have the right unit economics make sure you have the right fundamentals and there was no reason we should have taken so much capital Selena looks back on the thirty seven million and says Wow that was kind of crazy and it does seem crazy but that's the market you're in you have to play to win just as your competitors are playing the Wii you have to be the last person standing the truth is thirty seven million in Silicon Valley seems kind of average or even low side the amount of capital going in these companies has been growing its worth the risk because if you succeed you create something spectacular and Mariam is in full pursuit of the spectacular Eve the com in nineteen ninety nine to ten o'clock every night seven days a week she is flush with capital having raised more than she thought that she needed at the time and then the bubble burst and this was a very dramatic moment for those of us who live through in Silicon Valley companies were going under everyday there's this website devoted to covering businesses that are failing to say the name it I think we can although maybe the Let It Out which is obviously company is looking at it everyday and the modules are warning York Times says looks like the world from a young twenty nine year old's perspective your whole world is basically imploding and the Internet is over basically the the internet is over the me some of the punch line back then people really believed and the right response was Actually no interest you it's still coming this is actually precisely the time to bet on a dot com company I was personally look because I was in executive pay but only survive and in fact thrive through the dot com crash but I also read company I <Music/Noise> were splayed across a stage and those stories have a funny way of sticking as from area she sold a company just the nick of time I get my ass hole they've all made money basically I have made money at this point and feeling a sense of relief flash exhaustion at the whole rollercoaster going on so I think at this point just really wanted to get away and eggs at his leaf emphasis to fall back on top of the exhaustion the unexpected consequences we worked really hard on Eve da come and we made the right ultimate decision at the exact right time so that's good but we were often called fortunate lucky which we were and then when the whole thing came crashing down there was so much resentment that had been understandably built up around these young entrepreneurs with so much money to spend that was a huge backlash from everyone they were they thinking this is people have been shown to lessen rate and so he basically went from being someone to being absolutely no one and shunned and it was really humbling the the the was a particular experience which suddenly represented that shift from being golden spotlight to be completely pariah yes all the agencies that would call a city that always wanted to get to know you as a CEO or make your friend or your planes in and help you they are just busy overnight turned off the relationship has turned off and it was like absolutely no receptive be to anybody among the head hunting firms for example it is very much the opposite of alchemy and said I was really those really humbling when Mary was reflecting on a transition from being a grand Pooh bah somebody important to being a deliberately ignored nobody made sense to me it's a very human reaction to worry about how people look at you but you can't let this paralyze you when I consider investing in someone I look for founders who'll risk almost everything including notably the reputations in order to succeed Mariam now runs the risk of not risking enough and I saw a banker after this who is much older than I was your biggest problem life from now on is that your going to be too conservative I know you are at your curse curse is that you will be forever too conservative this idea of the conservatism really stuck with me a week later I was thinking about it <Music/Noise> when Mariam was commenting on our own curse the conservatives of the incentive being not to risk that had to make it look like it was just a fluke or mistake that may be kind of think about who the people that I see you also end up playing that way why do people risk why do I risk a lot of people risk it because they are still hungry have something to prove lot of people risk is to cut her wrist blind they just don't see a risk I can think of people in each of these categories when it came time for Marin to launch a second company she didn't want to take a lot of risk she wanted what's known as a lifestyle business the kind of business that's predictable and fairly safe with a steady stream of revenue that supports a comfortable lifestyle for its owners no big risks no crazy drama at least that's what she thought this summer as I said to myself let's not bring all of the season beginning I know but again this time so I chose no co founder this time no VC of this time let's figure out how to build perhaps a sustainable lifestyle business cash with us as I was thinking the beginning of Mariam and I had known each other from when she started minted I would actually told or abandon that differ from the very beginning because it's really a cup or so called lifestyle businesses are very stable and reliable technology companies just don't behave they need to move super fast and they need to be but costly correct and the need to be late for the twist and turns fighter plane com tech businesses absolutely need to raise more money I think the only only the capital for all of the unknown to its weather its new customer needs for competitive attacks to show you this difference between lifestyle businesses in scale businesses like Tech I want to talk the classic kind of on the kind I usually don't get to work with like almost had me he's the proud owner of the Wine Cheese Place in St Louis and he knows his business he <Music/Noise> also happens to be our producers that whining choose place that they are not sure if this Are you kidding me it's simple math question were opened another wine and cheese plates how much what it costs roughly four hundred thousand don't have to pull up a spreadsheet are now more being that game for so long <Music/Noise> pretty closely what it takes character and or send it out type of business is pretty stable it's all most stable or supermarkets the parameters are known the risk is low and that's why I bring you all deserve you see that not too many supermarkets goal under they may be more profitable less profitable but they are not going under the rate that someone like saying the fashion business all in the software business in Silicon Valley is no less real Silicon Valley is a wonderful place to live in but I want put a nickel there because I don't have the guts the perhaps older now has made me an adrenaline junkie but actually i look uncertainty is somewhat boring and that's the sort of certainty there is craving as he launches what she thinks will be a lifestyle we will head down that winding path with her name on the first note Marion's life had changed between First and Second Coming so I had become a mom in between I had my son and I just was having my daughter when he moved with this the sort of lightning bolt struck so being a mom an option or the sec time was really difficult and challenging but also I also felt like other people probably anticipated it being too challenging and the do rag down a little that if your mom and her pregnant and starting a company versus if you're a young twenty year old entrepreneur starting a company they are significantly different ways in which he treated actually a notch for raising capital is terrible yet you are the perfect kind of example of why that's an axe even a dumb idea let alone immoral I think I got seriously discounted despite the experience of having a success like that for people I said this in the room but I have to say it again the idea of discounting entrepreneurs who have families is ridiculous investors need to let go back to marry him wif my close friends and acquaintances knew that as get my easel friends said We believe in you screw it we're giving to a half million dollars assortment it so I did it was significant upside from having to live a successful exit and so Mariam launch new business minted an online stationery store not so different from upscale neighborhood card shop to stock up on cards from brand name companies but also included a daring little side experiment mem invited unknown artist to smite designs to an online competition anyone can participate anyone could vote the winners would then compete head to head with a heavyweight champs of the cards free and so in two thousand and eight Marin was ready to release are slightly off beat selection of stationery to the world here's what happened more in a moment after this word from our sponsor zipper we're back with Ian Siegel CEO of sap recruiter and the first customer service rep I asked him how he answered the phone I would introduce myself initially as an exceptional service representative there in these situations that would evolve where customers would say wad like to talk to a manager and I would have to confess it is they'll actually I'm also the CEO Ian has a phrase for entrepreneurs who take on every job under the sun he says they are suffering from a condition called hiring neglect sewed some bleak you personally were suffering from hiring neglect for at least one year oh yes it was when I look back on it now it seems ridiculous so I'm sure there are thousands of entrepreneurs out there right now suffering from hiring neglect how would you help them spot the symptoms I think that the that the defining characteristic of somebody who starts a business is Ian will diagnose your case of hiring neglect in the meantime you can try zip recruiter for free as a recruiter dot com slash scale the TV show and I open the doors there's not a cell for an entire month nobody wants the branded stationery products that we spent most of our two half million logic is again being conservative I said I know a journey of the Cal Poly's brands on line sign him up exclusively with explicit admission rates nobody wanted by Mattel instead the teeny weeny assortment eight source through this one competition I run one transaction a week then the next week there were two weeks or sixty designs for competitions and I'd save a tiny bit of money to build what I really wanted to belt out the tune of million is probably spent like hundred thousand what really became in Texas like little side thing as a programmer up in Oregon in here working at night on building the first competition and dies the only place we saw any sales movement Marion stumbled on the power processors idea that ordinary people when they come together in large numbers can do work once reserved only for experts at Season example of this Kickstarter as well but at this point in two thousand and eight was an understood very well something Silicon Valley was just getting its head I realize that this crowd sourcing Fein was way different and I'd uncovered something that was more like a massive social cultural change going on in the US and maybe in the world versus just some small business idea because what was happening that I didn't realize was that who is considered a creative out there is actually changing a lot right now due to technology exposure and so people are merging is creative soon haven't gone to school they haven't gone to design school having an art school and massively disrupting art design right now and there is a meritocracy a true meritocracy that you can actually build an on leash so sensible lifestyle business has nearly collapsed is only eighteen side of life in a funky little crowd source market place a place for amateur designers so cards adventure shoppers it's new it's different and aside from a chuckle sales there's almost no evidence of the work is only one certainty at this point Mary needs money a lot more money we're about to shut the company down I thought you know I could take whatever's left of the capital and has given back to my friends I cannot lose the money of my friends I was maniacal about that like <Music/Noise> it's a terrible hundred thousand to two thousand Aegis is going to be really bad I gotta give the money back but then my sights I'd seen these little bits of cells and my age to the angel he said You know I think that you need to save the company potentially considering venture capital the I think you should consider race and I started seeing signs of life too as I said I can say this company and I can get money back to investors I should do that reputations everything I want to do this so the centuries was primarily triggered by half to make sure I deliver to the Angels so basically the only reason to marry him get around to finance was the pair from the yes I was very much driven by a feeling of obligation and loyalty to my friends and so I raise the venture thinking that I would then save the company and somehow Taylor back not because they really wanted to raise venture I hear Mary runs into another reason you need to raise more money than you think you need unexpected opportunities Mary's plan to start a lifestyle business just didn't pan out she didn't have enough funding to cover Plan B or Plan B is I like this opportunities may arise later than you hoped you want the capital to carry you in new directions so she reluctantly picture idea and secured another round of funding that warm risky enough she's about to encounter one more familiar source of uncertainty the stock market and we raised our venture in two weeks before Lehman failed because this investor's mind that said to me after something really bad is going to happen in the race was run out August was in town anybody and if anyone in town August to raise money and closed it literally right before Lehman failed to point out the Times has fallen about eighteen percent this morning between three and four the percentage and believe it or not Mary watched a wildly risky experimental business idea into the heart of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression the collapse of the U S housing market in two thousand A suppose she waited until say September to raise that money Lehman collapses panic grips investors and no one in the right mind gives cash to lb old little experiment crowd sourcing like that meant it closes for business which is another reason you should always take the money whenever and wherever you can get it you never know when it will dry as it is Mariam did raise the money and she still has to create a thriving company so first just to figure out what customers really want I want to take you into the Heart of Mary Ann's grand experiment we're launching a business question is the only dancers believed to still more questions the question you hadn't even thought to ask you put a product of just the reaction surprises go back to drawing board to return with an improved product the customer surprise you get a bit like a mad scientist desperately trying to cool I bought this hand running up the budget allows the so I do a lot of my own focus myself with customers a moderate them I write the script still a lot I love to talk to consumers I do that many many times a year people are really shocked when they come in for focus groups and the sea is moderating but I love it because I'm listening very carefully to find little tiny nuggets of insight that I love collecting is there one particular nugget from one of those focus groups that comes to mind elk are so many like making prices all people for different kinds of paper and realize in analysis paralysis people whether you like almost had to give them a reason to make a decision to change in the price I was just fascinating I realize for example talking to people by Arts that's it really depends there are decisions depend alot on my to buy a home in which home there on frankly they're the first time second home to the Jacksons are telling us instead the company didn't care who meet to decide the short five years later the girl a quiet time the story more money here but these artists and what's going on here in the middle of a cultural shift millennial <Music/Noise> like to be involved in the wedding decision with the millennia women are more involved as the cousins actually turns out so we learned that our designs are too feminine way and you would Nestle even know to ask the question <Music/Noise> and that's the problem with building a business that has no blueprint for success you have to anticipate all stars design cards for brides and grooms are the ones by you give short shrift to the artist profiles and then realize millennials want their whole life story here's the lesson your customers are always a bottomless well of surprises how do you budget for an experiment on the scale Miriam has a simple rule of thumb in those early years when there is little access to capital we had to be really cash conscious the things are always more expensive than you think they are there always to take more time to prove out you need more optimization and more loops to correct things and you think you will that's why we to say roughly speaking it mean to act like a half because you've got a late factor in all the failures in on the optimization is that really killed great entrepreneurs and business all the time we know so many people both of us <Music/Noise> people who had good ideas on the right track they just ran out of runway want to point out something here Mary was an investment that she can crunch numbers and

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> Well hey there welcome back to another episode of the Online Marketing Made Easy podcast I'm your host Amy Porter filled and before we jump into today's episode I want to make sure you had time to check out last week's episode Number one hundred and sixty one was the episode where I interviewed my has been ho Bee now let me tell you this was a little <Music/Noise> bit nerve wracking I've never done anything like that before and I wasn't really sure what Toby was going to say but I think it turned out pretty good we talked about protecting your most sacred relationships as you grow your online business because let's be honest as entrepreneurs we can get a little crazy at times to get an Amen for that I mean <Music/Noise> and stressful times and when the money's not coming in consistently we can be stress cases and I think that's normal and I think growing <Music/Noise> business is dramatically different than working in a nine to five so you have challenges you normally <Music/Noise> never have if you're just going to a J O B and so I thought it was important that hubby and I talked about this because we had our ups and downs and we really have found our groove in terms of being able to communicate with each other and support each other when things get a little bit crazy so hubby shared his experience with being married to an entrepreneur I shared my experience with how I can support him better even when things are stressful so a lot of good lessons there and if you are in a relationship or you hope to have a wonderful relationship as you grow your online business I highly recommend you check out that episode Number one hundred and sixty one ok so now <Music/Noise> to today's episode we are talking all things Facebook marketing so almost two years ago in June two thousand and fifteen I wrote an article called The Ultimate Guide to Facebook engagement it was a huge hit still one of the most visited blog posts on my site well preparing for this episode I went to the old posts and I expected that all of the info would be completely outdated because we <Music/Noise> that Facebook rapidly changes however surprisingly so much of what I included in that article was still relevant so that's got a new kind of ease your <Music/Noise> bit right so let me give you some examples in the article I mention that Facebook is focused on the fan experience Mark Zuckerberg is all about the fan so the fan not the marketer that is still incredibly true today I also talked about engagement and I said that the engagement equation is simple increase your engagement the likes the comments the shares the views the clicks and get rewarded I said that the more often your fans engage with your post more often your post will be pushed out into the news feed this is still true and finally in the article I listed what was working on Facebook so two years <Music/Noise> I talked about getting personal and being human in taking people behind the scenes with your Facebook post I said that you have to focus on the fans that are actually common team watching your videos engaging with you and you've got to start a conversation with them I also talked about asking questions that are going to ignite a true conversation questions <Music/Noise> care about and you want to hear from your audience all of that is still very true but here's what's dramatically changed from just two years ago when I wrote that article the change is in how we are posting our content on Facebook and how we are actually getting engagement said this episode is going to examine how here's what will cover what's working right now on Facebook and what's not working in the number one thing you should stop doing on Facebook starting today I think you're going to love this debt and how to beat the Facebook algorithm and get seen and heard on Facebook ultimately we will be exploring video because that's what's really changed since I wrote that article two years ago there's a little bit of a mention of video in that article but nothing like what I'm going to get into today and this episode is not all about Facebook Live Baseball Live is a good thing to talk about but there's more you can do with video and there's a way you can ease into it so you're not having to go live <Music/Noise> from day one I'm all about baby steps and so I want to give you some ways to take some baby steps so that you start engaging on Facebook using video so let's do it night be doing you a huge disservice if I only focus on a few cool tips and tricks to try in your Facebook page because if you don't understand how things are working on bespoke right now you're going to cut off your creativity before it even begins to flow so first how things work I've broken them down into three Facebook truths The first truth was something I learned at Social <Music/Noise> World in San Diego Mike sells or did he know from stage and he shared with us that Facebook is running out of places for your content in the news feed yes you heard me right now two years ago when I wrote that initial article I actually quoted Facebook same there's more competition for what users see so only the highest quality content is actually going to get through and get shown to those people that was two years ago now just recently Facebook said that they are running out of places to show your ads say yes they were talking about ads now don't worry Facebook has a lot of other places they intend to <Music/Noise> so don't even think that you're paid media is in danger but they didn't say look we are running out of places to show your ad specifically in the news feed but if they're running out of places in the news feed for your guides that also means that they're running out of places in the news feed for your content which could mean less reach and visibility for you which ultimately could mean less leads in your email list and then of course you know what that means less sales so the truth here is that it's getting more difficult to grow your business on Facebook and I would venture to say across all popular <Music/Noise> sites it's getting more difficult I think Instagram is the next one will likely be talking about when we're talking about running out of space so there's a high supply content low available inventory but this episode is not at all about despair it's about changing the way you interact with Facebook truth number two Facebook puts the user experience before their marketers I mention this one already in the intro it's nothing new Facebook wants their users to see quality content and they want content that is designed to bring people back and they want their news feed free of spam and during the most recent election here <Music/Noise> there was this huge focus on fake news stories which bespoke is cracking down on as well so they're cleaning up their news feed they're making sure that it is a great experience for users which means <Music/Noise> are creating content you want to keep this in mind you want to make sure that whatever you're putting out there is a great experience for your audience now truth Number three this is a good one if your next post gets a strong start it's likely to be a big success this is something that Mike Stiles never got into detail while he was doing as Kino and i just ate it up I love everything about how he explain this so first I need to give him credit for this but then I kind of broke down in my own way as well so how does a Facebook post get a strong start it's all about the Facebook algorithm the semi you hate that word I can hate the word one and it's hard to spell tend to it's just so confused scene and it's supposed to be confusing we're not supposed to know everything about how the Facebook algorithm works because obviously if we did people would deem it even more but there is an Nath information or detail about that algorithm that you can use it to your advantage so I thought it would be really <Music/Noise> for me to break this down because when Mike broke it down on stage it made perfect sense to me so number one you post a piece of content on your Facebook page number to the algorithm kicks in and scans the contents and attempts to determine its substance so is it a text image recorded video live video what is it now what's important to know is that bespoke tweaks the algorithm to try to actually change human behavior what that means is that certain times Facebook will give certain algorithm make reference to certain kinds of content so for example recently Facebook came out and said the longer videos will get preference in the news feed they want people to stay on Facebook longer so you're making longer <Music/Noise> Facebook likes that and they're paying attention to that so if you can understand with some of these algorithm a preference is are you can use them to your advantage as a marketer that's why I'm taking a moment to explain this so again you post on your page the algorithm kicks in to determine its substance and then from there Facebook will selectively show your content you post your content it scanned and then selectively shown to a few of your fans now here's where things look good based on how your initial fans react to the content the algorithm expands work doesn't expand so if somebody clicks like or love or if they click on a lane if they comment if they share that is telling Facebook what people are interested in this continent if your fans react in the reach has expanded its no longer about scheduling things to show up at certain times it's no longer based on time as much as it used to be instead you post your fans reacts and if there's enough reaction again likes clicks comments views shares whatever might be then Facebook will start to push that out even more so a strong start is incredibly important I think more so than it ever has been before so how to make this actionable I want use to start to think OK I'm in a post this and what have I done in this post to get that surge of engagement to get a lot alike for clicks or comments and am I encouraging that engagement now Facebook doesn't like that you ask for likes so you've got to get creative here and get more human here instead of thinking as a marketer you know click like if you are greedy we use to do that back in the day at work like gangbusters instead you've got to approach this differently and think What could I do in this post that would make people react I recently saw speaking of Social Media Examiner I saw on their Instagram channel I forget who said it but the quote wise have to give something that people can experience not just watch because we're going to get into video even more in this episode I want you to remember <Music/Noise> that you want to post something that people can experience and not just watch and I think when you do that that's when you start to get the engagement so although I knew about the algorithm before Mike explained it on stage the big takeaway for me was that he mentioned this idea of that initial engagement or lack there at and if you have a really strong start you will see that Facebook will reward you for that and that's what we need to do differently we need to think of how do we get that strong start ok so those are the three truths number one Facebook is running out of places for your content in their news feed number two Facebook puts the user experience before the marketers and Truth Number three mm if your next posts gets a strong start it's likely to be a bigger success so now that you understand how it all works let's get into some of this seriously good tips and strategies for posts teen so that you can be seen and heard by your perfect audience on base but I've got five new rules of Facebook marketing let's do it rule number one last posts more quality when I heard Mike say this from stage of social media marketing world I was like bring IT ON I love this I love the idea of posting last however posting more quality and in my world more quality means that I've got to spend more time on some of those post so at the time that I'm recording this we're actually not implementing everything I'm talking about usually I like to wait till I implemented in the NIE report back on my own experience however this is too important to wait we're working on it right now and in the freebie that <Music/Noise> I like the idea that I get to share a bunch of examples from other people's businesses and not just mine anytime I get the chance to highlight other people it's always a good day and so in the freebie I found a lot of great examples of people posting last but more quality and that's what I'm showing <Music/Noise> in the PDF these quality post so when I tell you this you might think OK what does that mean more quality while I waited think in terms of getting the most mileage out of your content and this will make it a whole lot easier for you so start with a piece of original content that baby lives on your block C wrote a really <Music/Noise> great blog post now I want you to think of okay how can I use some of this content across all of my social channels how can I create a Facebook live out of this how can I do a face book story or an Instagram story from this what can I do on snap chat with this if you step to I don't but you might so let's think about this original piece of content that we spent so <Music/Noise> creating and getting it just right and let's take snippets of that maybe dig deeper with Facebook Live or take a snippet of that and share in a video <Music/Noise> on Instagram or whatever you might do so a lot of what I'm teaching you here you can use across social channels but you don't have to always be creating new content I know <Music/Noise> I likely don't get enough mileage out of the stuff I create every podcast episode takes me hours to create for you Obama put in the time I've kind of just come to the conclusion that it just takes me a lot of time to create this content but Obama to put in the time and effort and agony of trying to get it right then why not get some more <Music/Noise> out of it so let me give you an example with this episode I might get on video <Music/Noise> and created short little video about maybe one of these rules and I can put that on Facebook or Instagram or wherever I want to put it I can also do some other cool animated videos which women to talk to you in a moment to ease you in the video and I could take out some of the best nuggets from this episode and put in some animated videos on my Facebook page and then of course I could jump in one of my groups and talk about one of these topics extensively because they're so many topics in one episode so there's just a lot of ways to slice and dice the content you already have and use it across your channels now how does this relate to new <Music/Noise> last posts more quality or what I'm no longer doing is I'm no longer posting quotes in a static image I really have seen zero engagement from that stuff I'm also posting that last about what I'm doing but then again spending the time to maybe turn a static image into an animated image or video or whatever you call those will get to that so it takes me a little bit longer but it lives on a whole lot longer so I'm posting last content but putting more effort into each post on my Facebook page now for mean I have to say that I take this even one step further I don't expect a lot of engagement on my Facebook page because that's not where I'm focusing right now so that might sound a little crazy right and this is where things get a little bit weird because I don't want to steer you wrong but I also <Music/Noise> that you appreciate when I talk to you about how I approach things in my own business so take this as you will do what works best for you but what we've decided is that we want to spend more time inside of our facebook groups I've got three Facebook groups for right now because of the school but soon that one is going to be closing because it's finishing up so I've got courses that number webinars that number and list builders lab and what I want to do is spend more time in each of those groups helping my students encouraging them to keep moving forward and these are the people who have invested in what I've sell and so they are the people that I'm going to spend more and more time with now that doesn't mean that I'm abandoning my Facebook page not getting any engagement there instead my focus is on Facebook lives on my facebook page so if you've never purchased one of my programs you're not in any of my Facebook groups I still want to make sure that you are supported and so I <Music/Noise> an opportunity to connect with so <Music/Noise> people my audience if they don't happen to be one of my Facebook groups so that's how I <Music/Noise> my Facebook page to post last but more quality because let me tell you a Facebook live on my Facebook page I can't do tons of those I can't do many each week just because that's not my personality so if you want <Music/Noise> if you just go to facebook dot com for slash in the Porter filled you'll see my past Facebook lives if you missed it live and you'll see when the next one is coming up ok so last post more quality better you're deathly Ganassi for me on my Facebook page and hopefully you're going to explore that as well now we're moving on to rule number two and that is focus more on growing your community less on how many fans you have on your page this one's a good wine and that's exactly what I mentioned earlier just a minute ago about me focusing on the communities that I've already created I want to nurture those relationships more than I've ever done before so it's all about right now what's working it's all about the Facebook group now you all have heard me talk about Facebook groups a lot to hear the episode where I talked about deleting thousands of people from a B School Facebook group that I had because I didn't have the bandwidth to support it and I didn't want to not be there for them a link to that episode in the Senate is while but I love Facebook groups and I think he got to <Music/Noise> and so I talked about Facebook groups in episode ninety seven Episode Number one <Music/Noise> and forty six an episode Number <Music/Noise> and fifty one so I've given you a lot of tips but I thought What can I talk about that's new here for this rule of focusing more and grow in your community less on how many fans you have on your Facebook page one thing I can tell you is that I have noticed in some really great free Facebook communities that the leaders are doing a great job of connecting teen people in their groups and the way that they're doing that is their calling out certain people I've seen this in two different groups just last week so basically if you have a free Facebook community around a certain topic and you are the leader of the community <Music/Noise> in that group what you can do is when somebody asks a question and you <Music/Noise> that there's someone else in the group that could answer are probably better than you you actually give a shout out to that other person and say Hey Jane this is a great question and so and so let's say Jack is an expert in this area and I seen him do great things related to your question so Jack would you <Music/Noise> in here and getting a little insight to Jane and Jack and Jane are in your group and now you've connected them and you don't have to answer every question which can be daunting as the leader but also when people start connecting like that and helping each other but your fostering it you're making it happen you will be amazed how much more <Music/Noise> that group becomes to your mission it's just an incredible thing I've seen it happen and I haven't done it a lot however Lindsay my community <Music/Noise> Lindsay and I talked about this a few weeks ago and she's starting to do it more and more so I love that she saw it working as well so now she's calling out other people so I love that and here's another thing a tactical tip this is brand new hot off the press at the time of this recording you can now link your facebook group to your Facebook page and this is cool so when you go to somebody's Facebook page if they have a free Facebook community actually went to this for any of your clothes groups that are just for paid members so I'm not doing this however if you have a free Facebook group whether it's closed our own Ben what I want you to do is I want you to link that group from your page now it's hard to explain on a podcast so I'm showing <Music/Noise> what it looks like in my show notes if you go to Amy Porterville dot com forward slash one sixty two we actually have an example in the show notes that you can see exactly how it works n its really good and not many people know about yet so I highly recommend you try it out so there's too little tips for your Facebook groups but remember the rule is focus more on growing your community on Facebook like finding that community on Facebook last on how many fans you have that's just such an unimportant number compared to the other things you can do on Facebook to grow your business which leads me to number three so I was going to say one of the most important things you can do on Facebook is find your community and grow your community via Facebook groups now one day Facebook groups might not be as valuable then we're going to switch it up but right now it's working and I think you should take advantage of it but the second thing that I think is more important to do on Facebook versus worry about how many fans you have is advertise more use Facebook advertising now at social media marketing world I learned that only six point seven percent of businesses on Facebook actually advertise is that crazy or why six point seven percent of businesses on Facebook advertise that means a whole heckuva lot of people are not advertising their businesses they have Facebook business pages but they are not advertising now you know I talk about this book advertising a lot on the show some of my most current episodes number <Music/Noise> and twenty seven in one thirty five in one forty eight just wanna jot this down you can look at him later one twenty seven when thirty five when forty eight we will link to all of those episodes in my show notes for this episode so you can get to them easily opt the titles next to them he could decide if you wanna listen most of those are with my sidekick Rick Moore Eddie where we're talking about all things Facebook ads but I thought well how can I make this actionable for you right now at the new <Music/Noise> is to advertise more or start advertising then how can I give you some value here well if you're not advertising yet or if you're just dabbling in you just know in your heart of hearts that you're not really in it yet I want to give you three areas to focus on the most so as you start to explore as you start to get be on the dabbling and really doing three things to focus on Number one become a student of Facebook ad targeting know your audience and then <Music/Noise> how to find out where they're spending time on bespoke are more importantly learn how to re target them if you're already getting them to your website you're already getting them to watch your Facebook Live videos if you're already attracting them in other ways learn how you can re target number one become a student of targeting number to learn what it means to re target because I think that's the most powerful way to target with your Facebook ads re targeting which is something we're going to be talking about next week's episode Number <Music/Noise> and sixty three Rick and I are going to talk about the Facebook pixel and how to use it to re target are eight and then the third thing when it comes to Facebook advertising where you should be focused scene is getting comfortable with the power editor now I know that many of you just want to hire someone to do your ads it's pricey is really expensive to do so and a lot of times you really lose control of what is working and changing things fast enough so that you don't waste money unless the person is really really good which means usually <Music/Noise> expensive this is not always like these are not hard and fast rules I just notice it's hard to find someone who is really good at Facebook ads and they're not pricey because they deserve to be paid well so I would love to see you first learn how to do Facebook ads then consider hiring someone I do not suggest you go into it blind and then hire somebody I can even imagine if I never knew how to do Facebook ads and then I hired someone to do it for me there's a few things in your business where you can get away with a program mean developments coating all that you need to know it to hire someone to do it Facebook ads I think he should know it so my third area is getting comfortable with the Power Editor Don't let it scare you it is very intimidating at first I want you to work inside of the Power Editor is where you set up your Facebook ads again and again to show up every single week I want you to get in there is actually a very <Music/Noise> of your time if you're incredibly busy and you think you have no time to run Facebook ads you are leaning boat loads of money on the table that I know for sure I know for sure for my own experience and thousands of my students' experiences so if you feel like you don't have time to learn Facebook ads make time put something else on the backburner do a little ass in one area of your business so that you can spend three four five hours a week inside of the Power Editor setting up your Facebook ads experiment in learning targeting learning how to re target to me that can be some of the best use of your time again we'll be talking about this book adds more next week so hopefully you'll join me and Rick Moore Eddie and dive into it okay moving on to rule number four and this is a new rule remember so we're kind of change <Music/Noise> approaching Facebook new <Music/Noise> four or more <Music/Noise> more consistently now my friends I do not say this lightly because if you know me you know I don't love doing more video however I'm actually not talking about direct to camera videos those are not the only videos you can do the videos I think are the most difficult the first media staff there's a prediction that eighty percent of Internet traffic will be video by two thousand and nineteen this is from Cisco so eighty percent of Internet traffic will be <Music/Noise> by two thousand and nineteen that is really really soon from the time I'm recording this crazy right now I am still old school I think he'll I think I was born old school because every single day I read articles I don't necessarily watch tons of <Music/Noise> I like to read articles still whether it be on Newsweek or four herbs or People magazine I just like to read the articles I sound like I'm talking about Playboy how when the guy say they vie for the articles early <Music/Noise>"

says he needs to get whipped into shape before I may be driving it because it's not comfortable yet like no power steering CA rights right ok just crankiness hearing well yes and got <Music/Noise> Bush on the brakes and that scares me so that we either get this in a little bit better order but I'm very excited and is just a fun thing and I feel like lately I haven't been doing a lot of fun stuff I've been all about work work work I know you can really and how many people the scene right now can relate you put your head and you get into it and then I realize this is a feeling really fun right now so be it I've been talking about the scout forever and then I started to do some research because I am a master researcher and of course I found one right away so we under the bay little bit of a control freak okay maybe so but you kids keep that conversation so I get away see this out I'd also <Music/Noise> like cats love it I'm really excited so I forgot to tell you that's I guess it is shared with everyone and I haven't even put on social media yet see you all are hearing except for the first time in a long time I am <Music/Noise> myself so we're recording this way <Music/Noise> is not coming out for a few weeks so by the time this comes out many people will have already seen yet <Music/Noise> been there done that for a few years though Gee thanks Amy I doubt that wasnt as fun I guess I didn't think see this is why you shouldn't batch or I <Music/Noise> bash the shit hitting it well okay so here we go to get to it we're talking pixels in re targeting him and Rick and I have put together really nice outline so we can ease into all of this because I wanna tell u guys right now pixels are not my favorite topic Rick is a great job of explaining pixels at the end we're going to give you a link to a really great article that he's prepared around pixels but first I want you to hear him talk about it words can ease into this conversation because it can get really confusing at least it does in my mind so are you ready wreck ready to operate my first question now for those of you know pixel stay with us because we're going to get into a lot of questions that people have actually sent to us in advance so we're going to get into everything related to this whole pixel conversation re targeting organist are the top the number one what is the face but pixel and white is its purpose the proper question is as somebody put it What the heck is a finite self organized groups said she actually said What the hell is a pix all I said reckoning who should say heck yeah I guess it was that it will keep it clean and tidy Cali I did this to me with with like like like if you guys know pixels are ready we are really talking about a variety different things when it comes the pixel to it so we'll start with the foundational stuff and can move move through but that the Facebook pixel is a is a piece of JavaScript code that gives you so it's not something that you have to like come up <Music/Noise> or generator anything like that it's within your Facebook account and you can go to the pixel section and as manager and get what you have a facebook pixel assign <Music/Noise> your Facebook account and so that's the first thing I know that we have some questions of it down further about what's the difference between Facebook pixel and a conversion takes all it's just one pixel now and Facebook a phased out the conversion pixel in mid January so I used to be that there were two pixels one that built three targeting audiences and one that tracks you're able to use the track conversions while Facebook has one pixel they've actually had this now for a while like ovary over <Music/Noise> but officially as of I think I forget the exact date in February of twenty seventeen in a phased out the conversion pixels it is only one pic so you get one face that pixel per Facebook account and the purpose of this text is to basically track the actions that people are taking on your <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> page and also to track conversions so this is where it allows you to build re targeting <Music/Noise> based on where people are going <Music/Noise> what I know what visitors are coming to a landing <Music/Noise> up but also <Music/Noise> you to track conversions people who are coming the registration page or come in your sales page or opt in page and then actually getting to the next page there on that thank you page that's you know whatever the action is that that counts as a conversion for you the peso contract that ok that was really good day you made it sound we die and then it feels like a word that let's let's drop the mike ok so here's the next question for you how do you set up the facebook pics all ok so we want to go into as manager so going to our Facebook account into <Music/Noise> and then we want to go is the little Facebook causes and I apparently is designed Terminal three lines in the upper left corner of as manager to call a hamburger let me take us on the really fast Rick told me this already but I think this is one of your favorite things wreck you love the time to call the hamburger to hear how giddy I get to <Music/Noise> the guests like Facebook insider thing and so I think you feel cold with us I was at dinner one <Music/Noise> two weeks ago Laguna beach and I talked about it and there and this girl because yeah it's a designer chair I was like snarky but she was just like now it's a good designer term I'm like OK I love it it was news to me so just make sure you guys missed what we're talking about when you go into that power editor upper left corner the three lines yeah that Sam I say yes as <Music/Noise> decide the three lines they call the hamburger anyway thats or menus <Music/Noise> you click on that and even all tools and you have a whole bunch of options <Music/Noise> a pixels option so we get when you click into that that's where you can view your pixel Code and grab it meaning grab it like copy it and then from there as far as where and how do <Music/Noise> up it's going to go in so let's start with your website it would go <Music/Noise> the OK and it's going to go in the header tags action if the oven <Music/Noise> what I'm talking about here there are <Music/Noise> Wordpress there are some Wordpress themes that will help you do this you can simply does Google Wordpress conversion tracking plugins or something like that where you can even do Wordpress Facebook takes all plugins that sort of thing and you'll get all kinds of free ones they're super easy to use and will <Music/Noise> where it goes in your website's the money goes in <Music/Noise> of your of your theme ok when you do that that means its canal covering every page <Music/Noise> that's only step one now so the pixel place is step one the next step you've got to do when <Music/Noise> re setting up these re targeting <Music/Noise> actually go into as manager and set those audience <Music/Noise> up so for example okay great I want to tell the audience the people of anybody visiting <Music/Noise> in the past whatever thirty days ok great I can say that audience up now I can say I wanted the audience of anybody coming to <Music/Noise> complete guide to the Facebook ad pixel article ok great I can grab that URL I can build a return to the <Music/Noise> of people coming to that specific page so step one is good at pixel place step to which a lot of people miss they think the pixels place Okay great that's all I have to do on building re targeting audiences know that's not the case that the step two is super important you've got to create those audiences next now that's re targeting the other part of this is how use the pixel is for conversion tracking so again the pixel is going to go on whatever page marks the conversion for you so in very simple terms for example if we are running <Music/Noise> and we are however <Music/Noise> page after somebody opts in they usually land in the next page is like thank you for registering well that's where you want to make shore that the Facebook pixel it is on that thank you page in <Music/Noise> pages but to mark the conversion it's gonna be on that thank you page so again step one Put the pixel on that page step two is you've got to set up the conversion at that point and then from there you have two different options of a custom conversion and then standard events and I think that's the next thing that we're going to be talking about here now the custom conversion is the easiest to setup your limited right now to forty of them but a custom conversion all you need to do is once that takes place you can very simply going to talk in simple terms here you can grab <Music/Noise> of that thank you page and then as you're setting up the custom conversion and you'll see custom conversions by the way in the hamburger <Music/Noise> there click on that to set up that custom conversion it'll walk you through actually looks alot like setting up or re targeting audience so you do is grab <Music/Noise> of the Thank You page put into and we can put a screen shot of one <Music/Noise> notes page for a grandbaby soon it'll be easier for a visual aspect of it but just what you use the URL of the Thank You page and that's how you create the custom conversion you can <Music/Noise> it if you wanted see less to say this conversion is worth <Music/Noise> you can put a value <Music/Noise> that sort of thing so that's the custom conversion that's the easiest one today like that's very very For most people out there for like basic stuff the custom conversion is going to be very ample said to track conversions the next way to do and this is little bit <Music/Noise> is using a standard events and so you get the difference in advance base but gives you things like check out or registration or a lead or that's that sort of thing and you have different standard of and codes that you would say OK for the webinar registration okay I'm a grouch the registration standard event for example it's a little snippet of code and you would take that and inserted into the pixel on that thank you page and so now I can see people read Alison is like what the heck that he does say again this is a little bit more advanced when it comes to tracking conversions but it's really <Music/Noise> actually it's really not that bad as as as it <Music/Noise> as were explaining this all you <Music/Noise> you grab the corresponding standard of encoding and like if we're tracking whether <Music/Noise> we could grab the <Music/Noise> one and we take a little snippet of code inserted in the pixel in a <Music/Noise> his face but still work as and again that goes on a Thank You page and then you can give <Music/Noise> ago that's the different way the two different ways to track conversions ok so we just talked about what the pixel is what the purpose is how do <Music/Noise> up and then the two functions that is doing as far as the conversions go custom conversions and standard events now we talked about before and I'll stop here secondly know this is good I swear I cannot explain as good as you said you're on fire we talked about this as we got going <Music/Noise> we are recording the kids say when we're recording this if it's any secret or anything we're recording this in May <Music/Noise> and Facebook has just recently <Music/Noise> that they're making a change to the face but pixel which is going into effect on me twenty s of three days from now ok and hold your horses because they actually think it's not <Music/Noise> we think and Facebook hasn't really released a whole lot of information about this other than <Music/Noise> what they have what they sent me about this basically they're enhancing the Paxil to try to make the pixel smarter to improve the results of your ads and the delivery of your of your ad so that's a good thing and I think that this is I think what this update is going to be is all in the back ends like were I really don't feel like it's going to be a whole lot that we have to do another cabbie out right now Amy like if you're cool with it if if any kind of big changes comes up that we need to go back and talk about will do another episode on it I will talk about what these changes but I'm definitely bigger than we think will just redo this episode like you guys can be here in SF it's better but we don't think it's going to be that we really don't been the <Music/Noise> is like Facebook has not really release the whole of information <Music/Noise> big update to the pixel like they let you know like months in advance whereas like this suggests release really start to trickle out there be really <Music/Noise> it so I really think that it's not going to be that big a deal <Music/Noise> that the face by pixel is going to start sending more contacts and I'm reading for for what they sent me more contractual information from your <Music/Noise> to better understand and categorize the action that people take in your site optimized for as delivery all that means is they are working on in the back end to make the pixel smarter to get you better results okay and then one more thing they say is this additional information that is going to be sent through the pixel is going to include actions on your page like if you haven't add to cart button or the purchase button OK and it's going to be <Music/Noise> pages and again I don't get too technical here but it's going to be reading the pages <Music/Noise> to learn <Music/Noise> what type of actions that people are taking on your on your page again I really don't think this is going to be anything that we have to really do on our end maybe if we're <Music/Noise> standard events for like Add to cart for example maybe we don't have to do that again <Music/Noise> for tracking those types of things like e commerce people the cars businesses are doing this sort of thing more advanced stuff but outside of that I really don't think it's going to be that we're <Music/Noise> big change on our end it's going to be a back and change that the pixel they're making some changes the pixel make it smarter and this functionality is going into effect on me twenty three three days for when we're recording this I know and I still like I get I had it with my batch scene and then we hear something like that again I always have you guys covered so we need to change anything at this out whatever by the time you hear it will be solid one where the others are doing is you wary yeah I think the important thing though is that the foundations <Music/Noise> what we're talking about here are not going to change and they're not changing and so to understand the fundamentals here of what we're talking about in the foundation that's what's going to help you with your Twitter Facebook ads because I think that's what is most important in this is what Rick and I were talking about before I hit record and that is that I want my audience I want all of you to really understand what a pixel does what it's about why you need one which is basically everything that we started with in this conversation when Rick started to really get on fire way to understand the foundation so that when Facebook ads change in any way because they do a lie you have that solid understanding say you can add in flow with the changes versus feeling like you are so incredibly confused yes I was just having this conversation with somebody earlier today and we were talking about like what we think is most important for people to understand when it comes to like winter setting up Facebook as I said hands down understand the fundamentals of what they're doing so that when a taboo is five inches on the screen or a button looks a little bit different they can click on it and they can figure out oh you know what I get it I understand what that's doing it may be called something differently or might look a little bit different but I get it because once I clicked on here it makes sense to me because I understand the foundation yes that's or talking about here that Axel definitely okay so as I mentioned I collected a bunch of questions from those of my students that are in some of my groups and we kind of alluded to the fact that Laura was saying What the heck is a pixel and she said when does one use a pixel and you already talked about that how does one use a pick so we talked about how to set it up and then forth she says how does one measure efficiency of the dead pixel I love it I love it yes it's a great question in once you set the pixel up and you've got the conversions so in this case here <Music/Noise> like as far as conversions go how you measure the efficiency of conversions and that's why I'm reading her question here because I think part to this question is re targeting and to measure those conversions the efficiency of the pixel firing you are going to as manager and <Music/Noise> theirs that performance the customize columns for the reporting a drop down menu <Music/Noise> right hand side there of as manager you just want to click that I go to customize columns in that way you can select all the different data points that you want to see in your as manager in your reporting and say you want to go to him actually pulling up as manager on my and right now should have this up here but you go to customize columns and conversions under conversions on the left hand column there you see website and so this <Music/Noise> all of the pixel stuff so depending on if you did the custom conversion or using standard events you will see it here in the less and all you do is check the box next to whatever option that you want to see and then click apply and it will <Music/Noise> report and that is that's how you see and again I'm over simplifying it but essentially because we're not talking about a specific action we're tracking here you are going to customize columns click on the conversion section click on website <Music/Noise> and then there's things like the face but pixel or the cost per website lead or the conversion <Music/Noise> depends on what you set up is what you select and then there's this excellent section for custom conversions so custom conversion <Music/Noise> out all the custom conversion that you may have set up by by name so for example for me like purchase of FB advantage so I can check that box it'll show up in my report so you want to use the reporting feature nice this is good staff ok so before we get to a bunch of other questions that were sent in I want to stay with kind of the upper level we talked about pixels just pixels one o one and remember guys at the animal to give you a link so that you can check out an entire pixel one to one article that Rick has been working on but before we get there let's talk about re targeting because this episode is about pixels and re targeting targeting in the sense of how that relates to pixels so first before we get there what is retard be returning is I mean in the easiest <Music/Noise> is you were showing and had to choose <Music/Noise> who's alls who already look at a specific piece of content so for example if you on Amazon and you look at Kindle for example like purchasing a Kindle but you don't don't buy it then you're surfing the net later that day and you <Music/Noise> add <Music/Noise> but you see an ad for Amazon and I can tell you're looking at that's re targeting they're showing you that ad it's relevant to you because you are looking at that specific piece of content earlier I mean there's an episode that reckon I did willing to aid in the show notes at the show notes or any part of the com port slash one six three Rick and I did an episode about re targeting I don't know if you remember this wreck that was one of my favorite episodes because we talked about the targeting was all about we got into the specifics and then you and I started drifting off all these different ways we owe ya targeting and we didn't even plan that but we kept saying Oh but I tried this I tried that I thought it was <Music/Noise> for all of my listeners so I'll make sure to link to that because we can get into this even deeper but we already have another episode yeah that's that's why I said like the simplest form of explain re targeting is showing in an irrelevant ad to somebody who's already viewed at peace content of yours ok so that leads me to twenty pixels and re targeting go together well you can't restart well you can't you can't retire get a piece of content or <Music/Noise> or landing page people who visited one of those things without the pics like the pixel has to be in place as Facebook has to be able to know that like somebody <Music/Noise> so now in return get them on Facebook will face but the pixel is what allows them to know that they visited your opt in page or your website that sort of thing so when you want to re target somebody that has come to a specific blog post or specific show notes for your podcast or they went to your opt in page to sign up for your web and are but then they never opted and say you want to get out in front of them again in biting them back to sign up for your webinars that's when your Facebook pixel comes into play you set it up in advance then you can track where they are actually <Music/Noise> on your assets so it you can't do is you can't re target somebody else's website traffic or somebody else's opt in page were just talking about your specifically I got that question recently I wanted to make that clear now this is different then let's say re targeting people that have viewed a video <Music/Noise> sorry ass but yeah we're going to get to that moment that's a question somebody asked that the different Avery targeting that actually doesn't include pixels were going to get there so just ate stay with us here and am alive and that yeah yeah before we move on to our <Music/Noise> that so yeah I'm glad about that here in a minute you mentioned I know that people are probably saying OK <Music/Noise> I want to target people who landed <Music/Noise> page but didn't register or they landed on my opt in page but didn't opt ed so basically you want the pics on both of the pages like your opt in or your registration page and then in the Thank You page because then what <Music/Noise> is say OK I want to build an audience of people landing <Music/Noise> page and also <Music/Noise> who are coming and I think of age and so then what you can do is you can say OK now I want to target <Music/Noise> to that audience of people coming to my registration page but exclude the audience their landing on the Thank You page and by doing that I'm targeting people who went to my registration page but didn't register they didn't make it to the thinking pitch ok so I know you've said this already but let's say you can tell them <Music/Noise> they do that's at the edges so it was just there using the pages and so we want to make sure that that the pics we got the pics are from as manager and the pixels section and is a few different ways you can grab the pixel by the way it doesn't have to be in a pixel section where you grab the pixel from here as manager would place the pixel in the header section of your registration page a new lead paid his registration page for this example and also <Music/Noise> You page ok great we placed our pixel now we have to make sure that we go back into ads Manager in the audiences and create the re targeting audience is for people visiting each of those pages and so what you can do there you can there's an <Music/Noise> people visiting a specific page but not another and so all you have to do is grab <Music/Noise> page so visiting <Music/Noise> page and then excluded this <Music/Noise> and we're excluding the URL <Music/Noise> the Thank You page so really quickly you let air in the Power Editor you go to the hamburger and you're looking for audiences and then and there that's where you're setting up what I call rules is that with a calm setting at the ASEAN survey is actually a cool I just wanted to kind of move people back there because they're thinking OK where the heck am I doing all this ok so now that you've done an amazing job of setting up the foundation of pixels and re targeting as they relate to pixels let's get into some of the specific questions that were asked to build a house right let's build that laid the foundation member wine is from Donna and on as I get confused about putting a pixel on the specific page when I already have added it to my website I know how to add it to the page itself but I'm not clear on why I'm doing it or what it accomplishes when I do it the question it depends on what the goal <Music/Noise> here just from reading this question that what John is talking about is tracking the conversion says she's hearing okay I need to make sure the pixel is on a specific page there's a few different scenarios <Music/Noise> know the full information or the full context of what Donna's question here but let's just say it so I guess I'm really a question back I get confused about putting pics on a specific page where already have it added to <Music/Noise> website okay great you've got the pixel in your website's theme it's now covering all the pages <Music/Noise> you then that's step one and as I mentioned before you then have to go in and create the audience is that you wanted to target that you want to build and you might have five hundred different audiences or you might have five but like the basic for example as I want to build an audience of anybody coming <Music/Noise> in the past thirty days okay great or if there's a specific blog posts I want <Music/Noise> of people coming to that you have the thought of formula right now yes are you saying OK I want to run an ad to a specific blog post my website so I can re target those people with the registration or an opt in offer after that okay great so the pixels already <Music/Noise> but now I need to create an audience of the post page that I want to build every target high as four"
"38","Online Marketing Podcast","Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_164.mp3","you're listening to the Online Marketing Made Easy podcast Episode Number one hundred and sixty four The <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> well hey the hour welcome back to another episode of the On line Marketing Made Easy podcast I'm your host Amy Porter filled and today I am answering the question that I get asked almost daily on social media and that question is how I decide what content to give away for free verse is what content to include in my paid programs or harassed a slightly different way this is from one of my student's dad in my courses that timber program she wrote Amy I have a blogger that I use to attract customers and get people interested in my on line training program how do <Music/Noise> information on a blogger in a podcast with no give in my class content away for free so oh well played great this is a question that comes up a lot and it could be tough to know what content is best to give away versus what kind it you should keep inside of a paid program and if we are really taking a close look with so much on line content available for free these days how the hack do you even have enough content leftover to actually include in a paid program I mean have you ever thought that like Oh my gosh I cannot create any more content and I'm pretty much given that all the way for free so what am I even have left for my program so today my friend I've got answers when I say free content just so we're on the same page I mean the content you use in your Blogger or in your free videos or on your podcast or with your opt ins like your freebies yearly <Music/Noise> your content upgrades I'm talking about all of that free content anything your customers can access without spending a dime and for pay programs I'm talking about anything you've put into your online courses where students have actually paid to get access to now that we're on the same page let's get to it there are three core differences between free content and paid content I want to break it down P O core difference number one the free content is all about the what in the Y and the paid content you're creating should be about how so with your free content more talking about the way in the Y one of the questions I want you to ask yourself Is this what does your ideal audience need to know be aware of understand or believe before they are ever ready to buy your paid programs and that believe is an interesting word because it's either what do they need to believe in themselves believe in the industry you're in believe in the topic that you like to discuss what do they need to believe in before they will ever buy any of your paid programs or services now I have an online friend I've never met her life but her name is Diane San Felipe oh and has a great dancer Rahm channel going to do my show notes but when she dies is she really pays attention to what her audience is asking and so she's a blogger she's an author and in my opinion she talks a lot about different ways to be clean in the right for your body and so what I noticed recently she was talking about a low carb diet and that's not just what she's about but she did a two part series on this one thing she said I've been getting a lot of questions about Quito or low carb diet and I want to address some of those questions in a two part video series that she created on her YouTube channel and I thought this was so smart because I don't think she has an online training program just about Quito however she does have an on line training program around eating clean and living clean and so every piece of content that she has is somewhat aligned to some of her online training programs and some of her cookbooks and all the stuff she's got brewing so that leads me to this next section were talking about the what in the why of the free content I want you to ask yourself what are the big questions that keep popping up from my audience because typically the questions they keep asking that Boldin for your free content that's exactly what Diane does and why I'm always drawn to a channel thinking she uses free content really well also ask yourself what's working right now in your <Music/Noise> and what's getting big results and find out if that's what your audience wants to hear more about your pain attention to what's working in your nieces while and also what does your ideal customer believe about themselves or their situation that needs to change like if they're believing this is too hard this is not doable they're not a good fit for this or for that they're not ready whatever that might mean it to your audience you need to address it with your free content so with most people free content falls into categories with most people's businesses I mean and that is one around mindset to around strategies tactics Tips tricks whatever it might be no matter what industry you're in usually there are the tactical principles that you can write about new podcast about videos and then there's the mindset around it and if you want an easy way into the mindset typically you have to explore what do they believe about themselves or about their situation that needs to change there's a whole lot of free content right there so again if the whites and the why what is it and why does it matter those are questions you want to ask with the free content now with the paid you're given the how to execute in the form of a sequence or roadmap this is the step by step this is the in depth content so here's an example in my list builders Lab program I show you how to setup your list building foundation in your business I walk you through step by step how to set up the technology how to setup your content creation plan the whole shebang now in a lot of my free content around lists Bill Dean I talk about what goes into a list building foundation and why it matters the Y in the why I create free content about what it takes to have a list building mindset and I give a bunch of examples or lead magnets now why do I give a bunch of examples I tend to show examples of my free content because when you see it in action you <Music/Noise> it is doable so that's a strategy I use a lot examples and stories to make it real because part of my free content when I'm answering the question What does my ideal audience need to know well in my case with list building they need to know that it is doable and they need to know how it looks a lot of times before we dive into buying anything we want to feel it we want to touch it we want to know how it works well with an online business it's still the same metaphorically so a lot of my students need to kind of understand what it looks like before they say OK me here's my money I want that and show me the road map to get there so examples of whatever it is that you're teaching your free content when I see examples I like to show images or videos I like to show what other people are doing those examples make it real make it more believable make them realize this is doable so that's what my free content looks like so for my example it lists builders lab I have all the How To in the program but my free content is the white and the Y with a whole bunch of examples core difference number two is that the free content usually our individual tips and insights versus the paid content is a system or road map so I alluded to this already but I want to get into it specifically the best metaphor I can think of is a big full tree the branches represent your core free content so for me one branch could be a podcast on great weather our titles another ranch could be ways to come up with content ideas for your webinars so the branches can be scattered all about all around the tree great on <Music/Noise> but they don't really make up a road map to something truly cohesive they're just old my great ideas insights individual tips which is calm and when you go to some of these bloggers or their podcast or their video show all the free content however with my paid content you are getting the entire tree each branch lined up in a cohesive system and said are just learning about why they are titles or are out to create content for your wedding are you're getting a complete system to build and sell on webinars with my program webinars that convert and here's an important if you are learning where in the roadmap beings it was kind of like a big aha moment for me when I learn the difference between free content and paid content the free content what it does not offer is where everything fits the syntax and really with out the syntax it's difficult to get to see how it all comes together so your paid programs and services are the roadmap the syntax where everything fits together and also in a paid program knowing when to focus on what is priceless to your students knowing when to do this and then went to do that and when to do this because if they show up inside your pay program and they've already experienced a lot of the individual branches on that tree the good sense of what it takes to put together the system that you're teaching them but they have no <Music/Noise> what the road map looks like more specifically when to do this and when to do that and you know like a simple matter for baking a cake if you put the pan in the oven before you whip up all the ingredients well you're not going to have a cake great that's a really simple way to explain that people are painting for you to show them when to do what and how to do it so that's a big indicator of the paid content so here's a little secret you piece together all of my podcast episodes and probably figure out how to build an online course so I talk about pray seen in content creation in some of the platforms <Music/Noise> I mean it wouldn't be easy but there's a lot of free content between my content and then maybe a few others pieces of content from other experts you could probably figure out how to put together an on line course however he would be incredibly tough because everything would be scattered everywhere so with your paid courses your students are not only getting the best content but it's here rated thoughtfully and a complete system that is worth paying for our eight moving on to core difference number three free content is valuable paid content is not only valuable but specific and more detail so if you're free content you're going level one with your paid content you're going deeper and get a more detailed and specific it's either more advanced or paints a more complete picture with specifics in examples and details to round out the topic that you're teaching and example of this is my podcast on creating a wow experience with episode Number one hundred and twenty five if you want to check it out I talk about the value of sending a welcome email when greedy new students now in the podcast I give you a few tips and tricks to keep in mind when you write that welcome email in my pay of course you'll see me walk through how to do an entire welcome email sequence in great detail I give you examples I will drill <Music/Noise> on some of the advance strategies around it so on the podcast I give you just enough to understand it and then you can go off on your own kind of piecing things together and make it work resourceful people will do that for sure I've done it before and I know you could do it as well however if you want to go behind the scenes with your teacher if you want to see exactly what they're doing and you want to go deeper with them then you pay for the paid course so I think you probably would agree that a lot of my free content is incredibly valuable I hear it all the time I hear students a while that episode you did on the pre launch formula was so great and I'm literally applying it step by step right now and I went into detail with that free content I give a checklist to show people exactly how to do it but why would i give aways age detailed free content in a podcast episode of that episode is directly linked to so much of what I teach my programs if you do a pre launch or kneel at the likely want to launch I've got to what our course to help you lunch if you're doing a pre launch four new life you likely want to have an online program to sell eventually so I got a program for that as well so that alignment <Music/Noise> goes a long way so the reason I tell you this is because you might look at some of my staff and say Amy some of your free stuff is really specific and detailed and you just said court difference number three is that the free stuff is valuable but the paid staff is specific in detail all the great thing about your free content in your paid content is one you get to decide how deep you want to go and typically you won't go so deep with your free content if it is already included in a course now with that content is not included in a course if you don't go over that delighted in telling your course then use it as free content to knock the socks off your audience so I'm very <Music/Noise> of what my online courses are about what's included where I go into specifics and details and so when I think of a free piece of content that is not part of my courses but I can while my audience with it in it's nicely aligned with my courses well that's when I'm creating what I call epic blog post or at the podcast episodes where they really stand on their own people go back to them again and again and they like to share am so once in awhile you'll find that little nugget out there that you want to go deeper and more specific with your free content because you know it's perfectly aligned with what you're selling or what you eventually want to sell so I am here to tell you that it's not always black or white I am here to give you some guidelines <Music/Noise> it to get your head wrapped around what you could do for free versus what you want to do for your paid staff but it doesn't always have to be black and white and with that I've created three principles that I think will help you as we wrap it up before we go to the three principles a quick review of these core differences number one the free content is the what in the Y and the paid content is the how number two the free content is more individual tips and insights with the paid content is the roadmap this syntax The Fifth Down the Number three the free content is always valuable but the paid content typically is more specific and detailed in goes deeper let's get to those three principles to wrap it up now just in case you need a little more reassurance that you are on the right track with your free content I want to share with you to read content principles that I think will be incredibly valuable for you but before we get there I want to tell you what today's freebie is all about I created ten free content triggers for you because I know my students struggle the most with figuring out what to blogg about every week or what to do on their podcast every week or what to do videos on all that free content or what should be free be be about I get those questions all the time so actually re purpose to some old content that I used probably a year ago on the podcast and I made it better so you if you get all my freebies you might already have some kind of outline of what I'm giving you but I've made it better and I've come up with some new triggers for free content so still get this if you think you already have it because it's even better and made it better based on my understanding of where so many of my students are struggling with free content so high you get a new Porterville dot com forward slash one six or download any Porterville dot com forward slash one six for download or you can just text the phrase one six for download to the Number three three four four four so it's ten free content triggers if you ever feel stuck with the free content you're going to love this freebie you gotta get your hands on it ok so to wrap up here are my three content principles that I really want you to keep him my number one this is a good one so hear me out come a little closer stop multitasking if you're doing a bunch of stuff you're gonna like this one it's important your free content and your paid content can overlap in my podcast all offer up topics that I cover in my courses I mean I could think of three or four episodes just recently where what I've taught you in my free podcast can be found inside of my pay day programs however with eighty two earlier inside my pay programs all get more specific more detail all go deeper but there's always some overlap and not only am I saying that's OK I'm encouraging you to do that I think it creates a really nice alignment and I have been creating courses since two thousand and ten and here's something I've never heard and I've had hundreds thousands and thousands and thousands of students and here's something I've never heard Amy you teach us XYZ in the program but you also teach that for free on your podcast I never hear that and the reason being is that people like to hear things more than once and they like to review it especially when you're offering it at a deeper level inside your paid course A and a light bulb goes off when they realize where it fits in the sequence when they're inside of your paid course so I love to hear things more than once because the first time it doesn't usually sing again but now <Music/Noise> am I hearing Sunday more than once if I heard it for free and inside of a paid course but now you've put into the sequence and I know where it is how to do it when to do it so that overlap is okay you don't want to do tons and tons of it maybe two or three core principles from your paid course can find its way into your blogging videos and podcasts and all that good stuff then you save the rest for your paid program but overlapping is actually a good thing core content principle number two Don't be afraid to give your best stuff away for free I know I know you've heard this one a million <Music/Noise> times but sometimes it just doesn't see again sometimes you still fill the tiny easy about giving your best stuff away for free but here's how I can get you on board with this right away think of your favorite entrepreneurs are your favorite trainers educators people you learn from think about their contents their free content as it typically knock your socks off if it dies that's likely why you started to follow them and why you're so loyal to them they do not hold back Marie for Leo is a great example of this her Marie TV video shows every single week are exceptional they're really great information she never holds anything back and still she knew a multi million dollar launch with the school the reason being is because the school goes deeper it's more specific there's a road map there suggests know don't hold back and here's a little secret that I use when I'm creating free content and especially when I'm thinking specifically like OK this free content the lines really well with my paid program and maybe I'll use this free content the beginning of a finals so it's like an epic blogger an epic podcast it something that <Music/Noise> it to stand on its own I won a lot of people to share it like it's really good when I'm creating that piece of content whether via podcast episode or a freebie inside of a podcast episode whatever it might be if I feel a little uncomfortable that it is so good that I probably shouldn't give it away for free that's when I know I've done it I really nailed it that little feeling of who this is so good I don't want to give it away for free but I really should then I <Music/Noise> I've got it if you don't feel that little tinge of this is so good then I want you to keep at it not with every piece of free content I just mean those really good ones that you know you're going to do a lot with and number three your free content should lead it to your paid content I said this a lot throughout this podcast episode alignment alignment alignment this is something that I've probably learned more so in the last two years because they've seen it actually worked for me than any other principle that I've taught lately and that is that when I sit down to create a piece of free content podcast episode a lead man meant some kind of freebie of any kind I ask myself where does this fit into my overall message Dean of the stuff that I teach and if it's way off the wall I likely will not do it so let me give an example I likely will never make a video or do a podcast episode about my favorite masks some human are like What are you talking about mask I mean like a beauty mask you know something to exfoliate my skin or you know the clay masks the mass that women put on their face menu too but more likely women so I likely will never do a video about that and the reason for that is it has nothing to do with my business of what I'm selling what I am Bill Dean where I want to go know what I might do is have a little fun in an Instagram story and I'm taking people behind the scenes I might share my morning ritual or something like that that's where I can get more personal have a little bit more fun I've never done it but I'd be open to it but when we're talking about blogg post podcast episodes freebies I'm gonna stick to what is aligned with my brand my messaging and I really do believe in I know not everyone's going to agree with me here but I really do believe that so many entrepreneur worse take a little bit too many liberties on what they talk about in their core content that things get a little bit confusing so I'm really advocating for its stain in your lane with your core content knowing how things are aligned and then have so much fun with social <Music/Noise> video Facebook Stories in Saran saree sat chat whatever take people behind the scenes I highly recommend that you need to do more of that but there is kind of like a time in a place for stuff like that and I do believe that that has made huge difference for me now the last thing I'll say more at the site is that not every piece of content I create is aligned with one of my three programs so if I add more programs I think that would still be true so sometimes all interview somebody around a topic that is not my specialty but I believe it would be incredibly valuable for my audience or I tried something that I never get to teach inside a program but it was so cool and valuable that I want to share with you guys I'm all for that but in general <Music/Noise> when he come to me you're likely going to learn about list building course creation webinars finals Facebook ads I stay with that staff that one I know really well but two that's what makes up my message in my brand so I just want to share that with you because I do think that's a distinction that has helped me get to the success I have today seem I want to just write on for size you might be saying Amy you're full of Ed that's not true by all means you do you do what works best for you I dislike to share with you what I know works in my business and those of many of my students ok so I got on a little bit of a soap box I try not to that too much with you guys but there you have it so let's go ahead and wrap it up the freebie for today is a repurposed piece of content that I made it better so it's worth checking out ten free content triggers so if you ever feel stuck on what to create what to talk about for free to create lead magnets like cheat sheets and checklists in blue prance around if you ever feel stuck I've got a really great one page resource for you so all you need to do is go to any

I came up with these ten I made him so much better than I've ever done before I think you've got to get your hands on these are eight I can't wait to connect with you again next week if you want to

"39","Online Marketing Podcast","Online_Marketing_Made_Easy_Podcast_Episode_165.mp3","your listening to the On line Marketing Made Easy podcast Episode Number one hundred and sixty five the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> Well hey there welcome back to another episode of the On line Marketing Made Easy podcast I'm your host Amy Porter filled and today we're talking about how to troubleshoot your biggest weapon our challenges now if you are doing webinars right now and things are going as you had hoped or if you're thinking about doing webinars or you've done webinars in the past and the results were less than dismal so your little gun shy to do them again then you my friend are in the perfect place right now this is a must listen to podcast if you are in any of those scenarios now before we get into the troubleshooting areas that I want to dive into today I want to talk to you about something that came up in one of my Facebook groups so recently I have been re working my lists builders Lab program so if you're in list builders lab you're going to get a whole lot of brand new content coming your way and if you've been thinking about joining my lists building program it's going to be brand new very very soon so I'll talk about that when we go live with the brand new stuff but I've been diving into surveys about the program from my students ways to make it better where their struggle even if they're not getting to the finish <Music/Noise> that and so I have over three hundred and fifty at this point might be more like four hundred surveys that I've collected in literally pouring over all of the details and then I took all of that information and asked more questions in my list builders Live Facebook group to really narrow down some of the big topics as a side note next week's episode is how I rework existing online training program since I'm doing it right now and list others lab I thought I would share with you exactly how I rework a program that's next week's episode Number one hundred and sixty six anyway that this I know so I bit in the thick of redoing this program looking over surveys and here's something that has come up again and again and again the word overwhelm any which way you want to say that I'm overwhelmed this is feeling overwhelmed mean overwhelm is taking over overwhelm overwhelm over while I hear that word probably twenty times a day for my students in my groups and then the word is probably the most use word throughout all of these surveys and because I was just really intensely into these surveys the other day it just really stuck out to me that we use this word way too much to hold us back and the reason that I'm bringing it up here and forgive me my students who have already heard this in the group stay with me here but the reason I'm bringing it up now is that you can't keep telling yourself that you're overwhelmed all the time because guess what's going to happen you're going to stay over while there's nothing good that could come out of telling yourself everyday I'm stressed out I'm overwhelmed this is too hard I can't figure out the tack and I mentioned this somewhere else I don't think on the podcast but I recently had lunch with a good friend of mine Elizabeth de Alto in Elizabeth and I go way back to our Marie for Leo mastermind days and she said that she hears this all a lie in her groups as well and she's a tough little New Yorker in she said this is what I say to my students I say if you're so overwhelmed if you're so stressed out if you're miserable then maybe you shouldn't be an entrepreneur maybe you should go back to your nine to five job or just quit this whole idea altogether just don't do it because no one said you have to do this you definitely do not have to build a business online you do not have to be an entrepreneur and she said when I tell them that I noticed instantly that I get pushed back and she said I love it I want to push back I want to tell my students than buying don't do it and I want them to say was no way you can take this away for me I am going to build this business I am going to be a badass entrepreneur this is mine watch out world she said I want them to have that fire because the other conversation <Music/Noise> I'm overwhelmed this is too hard stressful is going to get them nowhere but stock and so I wanted to share this with you because I thought it was so important for you to hear today this is a lesson I have to learn as well we can keep talking about the overwhelm its too much we're saying it too much where living it too much he got to change the conversation you know it's all about mindset right you know that in your bones however we still stay stuck in our mind so instead of sane today this is overwhelming <Music/Noise> is too much this is too stressful I am overwhelmed instead of saying that let's flip the switch on the conversation we're having in her head and instead try something like Okay today I may figure out this one thing to take action on one thing today that's going to move me forward or get to do this as another thing my husband Ho Bee talks about a lot with me so when I go down negative town because I definitely do when I start sane I have to do this or they can go to the movies with you right now because I get this done I have to do this he always helps me and I encourage him to do so he says let's flip the switch on that and let's say you get to because you don't have to do anything you meet u r the boss or he'll tease me and say well then you should talk to your boss in teller that this is crap you're working too much in right away kind of puts me back in the state like oh wait a second call the shots here so let's start talking about what we get to do and lets are talking about taking action in putting her head down and doing the work versus talking about how stressed out overwhelmed be a ok that sound good just today just focus on today watch what you're saying to yourself Really Be careful what you're saying to your husband or your wife or your friends what you're saying to yourself in your head let's flip the switch on that conversation because of the getting us nowhere deal ok so let's get into today's episode all about troubleshooting your biggest weapon our challenges so as I mentioned in the beginning if you've ever had challenges with webinars or if you want to do webinars in your little bit worried <Music/Noise> how much work they take or how complicated they might be today is like a checklist of different areas that you can troubleshoot to make sure that if your stock you can move through it and if you haven't tried it yet you can sidestep some of these big mistakes now of course I have a freebie for this episode because I want to make it incredibly actionable for you the freebie is called Your whether our problem solving tool kit and it is a series of checklists categorized by different categories that were going to go over in this episode today that will help you become a weapon our detective carefully <Music/Noise> on those areas that aren't working quite as they should be you're going to love the weather our problem solving tool kit because if your webinars right now you can use it literally in this moment or save it on your computer and when you are doing webinars next take it out and <Music/Noise> it to make sure that you've got everything covered city get your hands on the web in our problem solving tool kit go to any Porterville dot com forward slash one six five download or her you can text the phrase one six five download to the Number three three four four four I'll talk about the freebie a little bit more at the end but let's get to it know it's important that you actually listen to this episode not just grab the freebie and Sam are doing webinars right now get to it later because I am <Music/Noise> with you a very personal experience that I've gone through and something that I never talked about before but a strategy <Music/Noise> right now to troubleshoot a challenge in my business and it's going to be the very last strategy I share with you today because it kind of sums up everything that might be going wrong in a campaign you're doing and it identifies what's going wrong even if it's not whether our campaign maybe you're doing a challenge or a video series or an email marketing campaign whatever it is this final strategy Emma share with you on this episode could totally identify what exactly is not working it's so gay but I want to save it to the end ok so let's go ahead and we're going to dive into three areas of troubleshooting your web in a challenge <Music/Noise> my Facebook ads are converting challenge number two my wedding our registration page isn't converting and challenge number three my <Music/Noise> isn't converting when I get to challenge number three that's when I'm going to share this very personal troubleshooting strategy that I've been using my business and that I want you to use in yours as well are you ready let's get to a challenge number one my Facebook ads are converting Dominic over a few areas the most important areas that you want to pay close attention to if your web in our ads are not turning into whether our registration leads however in the freebie I add even more areas that you can look into so the freebie is going to have a lot more included but this episode is going to get more into detail about the areas that are most important for you to troubleshoot so when it comes to ads you can probably guess that the first conversation I want to have with you is around targeting if you're having trouble getting your ideal audience to actually click on your ad mean you feel that there might be very little interest in your web in our topic because your ads are running and nobody's paying attention one reason for this might be your ad targeting now another reason for this might be you missed the mark on your web in our topic we're going to talk about that a little bit later but let's just say that you might've missed the mark on who you're putting your ad in front of on Facebook so let's talk about that in terms of targeting if there's one area in your business not just with ads but if there's one area in your business where I want you to become an expert its ad targeting even if you plan to hire someone to do your ads I want you to hand over a list of targeting opportunities that you personally researched at least to give the person who's doing your ads a jumping off point so I love the idea of using a Google Doc to keep a running list of all of your targeting idea as a list of all the pages on Facebook that you either tested yourself already or you want somebody to task for you and all of the re targeting combinations that you thought of as possibilities again you want to master this area in order to optimize every penny you spend on ads so when it comes to the fact that maybe nobody is paying attention to your ads they're just not even clicking on your ads or very few people are clicking on your ads and nobody's actually opting into your web and are I would start with the targeting I would make sure that your use in multiple ways to target on base buck so I want to make sure that you are targeting other people's Facebook pages I want to make sure that you're targeting your own Facebook fans you're targeting your own email list if you have one and most importantly I think is that you are re targeting your re targeting everybody that does click be adding goes to the registration page but doesn't actually opt in your re targeting everybody that comes to your website or maybe comes to specific pages on your website have to do with your web in our topic you're re targeting in any way possible you can even re target the people that are engaging on your Facebook page or talked about it alot re targeting anybody who views one of your Facebook Live recordings on your Facebook page you can re target all those video views whether they watch live or they watch the recording re targeting is definitely where it's at so if you're not doing all of these things you definitely are not doing enough with your Facebook IDs and this is one area that you can troubleshoot this is where I want you to start if your ads are not converting well now I have some resources for you so if you think OK me I really haven't honed in on the targeting opportunities for my ads is not really fair to say that they're not working because my targeting sucks okay you can say that sometimes that happens because of that I want you to listen to Episode Number <Music/Noise> two Facebook ad targeting one o one I did that episode with Rick Moore Eddie one of my favorite episodes and I want you to listen to Episode Number one thirty eight of Rick's podcast so Ricky did a episode just recently and it was called Facebook ad objectives what they mean and how to use them even before you get to targeting you have to choose the Add objective any ad objective works in hand with your ad targeting and that I wanted to bring it up here Rick literally just text me yesterday and he said I did really <Music/Noise> really good podcast episode people been asking me about how to choose the objective for my actual ad campaigns I thought Oh my gosh perfect I mean because I want to tell my audience about that so with that Rick Moore Eddie dot com episode one thirty eight I'm going to give you a lot of links in this episode and I'm going to include all of the links in the show notes so Amy Porterville dot com forward slash one six five can be your one stop shop everything you need to know in terms of links will be waiting for you there at the end of the show that's now before I go any further I want to tell you this I'm going to give you a lot of trouble shooting opportunities today this is a <Music/Noise> good mini training for you to troubleshoot your weapon are but you can't get off the webinars one he can say I'm so overwhelmed because the goal here is you choose one area and only focus on the first so if I give you a list of ten ways to troubleshoot your web and are you are only allowed to choose wine and say I'm just going to focus them have blinders on to the other nine things at the knee and said I don't know if it's tentative count but you get the point to put on blinders I'm not going to think of the nine other things I'm only gonna focus on this one thing that tell you be overwhelm you don't allow yourself to swim in all of the opportunities in all of the idea is you choose just one promise me to guess where you're only going to do just one of the things that I suggested a half to do that you can move on to the next thing and that's why I created the freebie for you so you won't forget what the next thing is you want to move on to with troubleshooting will just be there any beautifully designed p S Okay moving on so we talked about targeting when he comes your Facebook ads that they're not converting while it might be your ad image or your ad copy if you're running a static image ad I definitely want you to try out a few different ad image is just to make sure that you're putting some options out there so what we typically do is for one ad campaign we might create for five different images will test those ad images against the exact same copy so we're only comparing apples to apples and will run it for but a day or two in pretty quickly will know which ad images are actually pulling in the right audience and sew them will kill the other ones in we won't run them so I want you to make sure you come to the table with a few different add images to test not just start out with one also be very careful that you're not using stock images that are way to what I call stocky like you don't want them to look like the typical stock images so that no guys in briefcase is in a boardroom or a bunch of people in business suits giving high five like we noticed a way from that cheesy kind of stuff right even more so now I feel that you can play around with your images and try stuff that you've never done before and what I mean by that is I want you to look in your News Feed and I want you to pay attention to the images that are really grabbing your attention that's the best way to figure out what's working now because so many people are running ads that there's no way you're not seen him in your News Feed and here's another little tip if you're not seen a lot of ads in your News Feed maybe you need to go in like a bunch more pages on Facebook definitely like your competitors pages because of their running ads you definitely want to see them a lot of people speaking of targeting an earlier a lot of people will target other Facebook pages so if you're a fan of certain Facebook page you're likely going to see ads in your News Feed so what I do is I make sure I'm a fan of a lot of different Facebook pages a lot of different Nisha is so that I can see a lot of variety at Facebook at I want to see the ads in my news feed because I'm a student of Facebook ads I want you to do the same ok so coming back to images I'd only use those stock images that are really cheesy so what I've done is they put together a short list of resources for stock images that don't like cheesy I know I'm using such a technical term here right my designer Jessica Rae has some great resources that she shared with me and I'm going to put them in the show notes so I think there's at least three different sites them and send you to all free but they're worth investing in and you can look at these images and see if they're going to be something that you want to check out ok so moving on to copy when you're troubleshooting why your dad is not working you definitely have to pay attention to the copy as well remember you're not going to change at the image in the copy at the same time causing you don't know which one wasn't working or doing these things one by one but when it comes to copy conversational it's gotta be conversational and it has to be attention grabbing so again it when you're in the news feed if you see an ad that grabs your attention likely it's going to grab your attention because the video ad or has a good image but second to that when you start reading the ad copy is a good does it grab your attention to the pool UN does it make you want to click if not it's boring what is boring about it so pay attention to that is well now here's what I <Music/Noise> you to take this action I want everybody listening to take this action I want you to make sure you use something like Gina or snag it or or stitch so all into all three of those <Music/Noise> notes Jing snag it or stitch and all of them allow you to take screen grabs whatever you're seeing on your computer but beyond just taking a screen grab the reason I like stitch the best as I think it takes the most crisp pictures of all those three tools but stitch allows me to take an image and then quickly save it as AJ pagar PNG on my computer another reason why actually want to save it as a file is because if you use that's a drop box I want you to create a Dropbox folder that says Facebook as examples and then in the Dropbox folder I want you to have the re boulders from there one that says add image is one says ad copy one says other and every time you see a really good ad that has great copy or great imagery or just something different about the ad that you love take a snapshot of it and save it right then in there and the reason why I'm taking it one step further and say mm get organized in your Dropbox is because how many times have you taken a snapshot of something that you wanted to remember and you have no idea where it lives on your computer right now having we've all been guilty of that so get organized again you're becoming a student of Facebook ads so want you to take the snapshot file them are right away in the folders and so next time when you sit down to create your ads you've got this great swipe file of all these examples that you really find valuable and you can use them for inspiration so I want you to do that today that is one action I want you to take right away okay moving on we're talking about troubleshooting your Facebook ads if you've been using static image ads since the day you started running ads then I want you to consider doing a video ad instead in almost every instance that I've seen in my business a video ad will come are way better than a static image at now if you're going to do a video ad I would it make sure that you look at some resources and get some tips on doing video ads Rick Moore Eddie talks about them on his podcast digital marketer has a podcast called perpetual traffic they talk about video ads so before you do them learn a little bit about how to do a video ad and one million percent it is worth your time and effort to do so so running a video ad to talk about your wedding are and to encourage people to sign up for it that is a game changer in most situations I want you to look into that if you're not doing it yet and the final thing I'll say about troubleshooting your weather our registration ads is you gotta make sure that you had the pixel and all the right places so reckon I just did a podcast Episode Number one sixty three all about the pixel if you're just starting out we talk about the pics of what it is why it matters but if you've been out for a while and you've already placed your pics on the right places we talk about troubleshooting just to make sure you did it right and you're optimizing so you have to use the pixel like there's no <Music/Noise> it if you're running Facebook ads develop a web and are you must must must be using your Facebook pixel we talk about it in episode one sixty three ok so at this point it is a good de bras going to shake it out a little shake your body and know that I just went over a few different ways a lot of ways that you can test your Facebook ad if it's not converting to get webinar registrants only going to choose one of those at a time Ray and I would say let's focus on targeting share ok so let's just say that you're running a Facebook ad and is doing well people are clicking on it and they're coming over to your registration pages but your challenge is that nobody's signing up for your well being are once they hit your web in our registration page this one happens a lie I hear this from my students a lot they say Amy I'm getting collects five hundred people have clicked so I add two people have actually registered for my webinars now this is frustrating because I know it takes a lot of work to set up your ad campaign set up your registration page set up all the emails that follow a webinar registration page you've done a lot of work to this point and now you're literally spend the money on your ads people are clicking but the Seine to talk about it number one you've got a look at your messaging is there an eye to registration page mismatch is the copy in your ally aligned with the copy on <Music/Noise> page if there's not a clear connection if the conversation doesn't pick up from the side onto the red page people are not going to trust you enough to give you their valuable asset name and email to you first need to make sure that the conversation is aligned now here's something that I would love to see you try out and this is something we've done in our own business and have seen really good results what we've done is for most of my webinar registration pages we have taken out all that hot be on the red page mean for the most part you will rarely see bullet points on our registration page instead we put all the goods in the Facebook ad copy the web in our title what you're going to learn the bullet points we put all that information in the ad copy so that when you click on the bad and you come over to our registration page we usually use some good imagery on talk about that the SEC and the title of the web and are a subtitle in a button and that's all you're going to find that no one to show you what this looks like so in the show notes we actually have an image in the show notes of one of my web and our registration pages that is exactly how I just explained it that sometimes is easier to see it and just to hear it the reason why we do this is when somebody clicks on the ad we wanted to be a no brainer decision to sign up and when you go to a registration page and you already have the information about what you're going to learn the only thing you need to do is click and sign up you don't need to read everything on the registration page you don't need to decide if this is something you want to do you'll argue decided because of the actual had this no brainer decision gets people to sign up right away like boom and sign up and we have seen a huge increase in conversions from AD to actual anime paid signups when we did is we been doing this for over a year <Music/Noise> and it works really well it doesn't work for everybody works for my business but I want you to experiment to see if it works for your business as well and what you can do is you could run two different ads going to two different landing pages and you can see is that the longer landing page that works best with shorter copy in your ad or is it a combination of a different way to do it you get the point so I want you to try that for sure again an example of the landing page an image of it will be at the Porterville the comp board slashed one six five ok so speaking of your landing page I mention that we usually use an image that is appealing to my audience whether it be the image of me is that they can identify I'm signing up for in these webinars or sometimes is not an image of me at all actually let me see if I can grab two images making no promises but I think I can find two different images one includes mean one doesn't see you can see the difference both of them are converting while ok so imagery matters and leave pages which is my tool of choice so if you just go to in the Porterville dot com forward slash lead pages you can check out the tool I use for all of my landing pages and they have a template that is meant for just one big image and a little bit of copy and it's one of their highest converting temple it's so worth looking into now there's one more thing I want you to think about and that is that if you are going to use more copy on your landing page I think it's wise to have a little section about who you are especially if you're marketing to hold audience so if you do add more copy on the landing page at the very bottom if you put a little blurb doesn't always be the very bottom but typically that makes the most sense a little blurb about why you are the best person to teach this content so here's where gets a little bit tricky it's not a bio it's not like five six sentences of your bio but you're writing it specifically for the web and I are teaching so if your teaching on certain topic that bio should be two or three sentences and basically explains why you are the guy the girl to be teaching this topic so something in your experience or skill set makes you the expert to teach you gotta talk about that in the little clip about you and maybe a picture of you included so people can connect with you I think that's important especially if you're just getting started your audience is not your audience yet you're still trying to attract them they might wanna know who you <Music/Noise> it matters to the topic that you are going to learn about our eight I have to resources for you that I want you to check out they are both blogged articles that are incredibly valuable and they were written by lead pages the company that

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> well hey Barry E Porter Field here and welcome back to another episode of the On line Marketing Made Easy podcast I'm your host entirety said that artists I was a new Porter filled so we are just moving on to this that spire which is this episode is all about the play by play to rework your online course before I get into today's mini train I gotta tell you that if you ever really good year for audio and then you likely already <Music/Noise> that this does not sound like my typical podcast now for the record I do not have a very good year for audio so I'd have no idea but if you guessed it you get a gold star I'm actually in my brand new video studio however have it setup to record the podcast if you follow me on Instagram which I hope you do I'm just at the Porterville on Instagram I've been doing since the stories about my brand new video studio we've been working on the backdrop we've been working on all the lights in the camera as in all the <Music/Noise> I mean it's a big to do and I told the guy David Foster is his name who built my video studio he works with his partner Lori at and they are at Live streaming pros dot com until David Look I need to do my Pi cast in my video studio so that all the technology is in one room so that I can make the other room my office without all this recording equipment everywhere and so that's exactly what he set up here except that we're not one hundred percent done so because of that I am just reporting on a Yeti my into my Mac computer which is then going into screen flow so for all you techies who asked me What are you using as of today that's what I'm using just because this is a little make shift until we get the video studio to support my podcast recording as well or very very close so anyway just wanted to share that with you if you picked up on a little bit of an audio difference now most of you probably did not pick up on that like I said I never would have so now let's move on to the play by play to rework your online course today I'm talking about a process that is humbling each and every time I do it looking at one of my courses in St I could do better it's time for a re work to be clear here when I say I can do better it's not about being a perfectionist but more about looking at the feedback in the day that and knowing that my students need something more from me or need something different or need something new that I did not offer the first time around but know that they need to include it now so why so humbling I think for me it's the idea that this baby I produced isn't perfect if you already have a course then I'm sure you can relate I put a lot of work into my online courses a lot of blood sweat and tears and I leave it all on the battlefield when that course is completed so it's not like I go into this half hearted I'm all in so when I go back and realize whoa something needs to be reworked some things a little bit off here that's the part that humbling for me but the thing is as entrepreneurs you how those moments rate I know that I have them more often than I'd like to admit so those moments when you <Music/Noise> need to do something differently that may be your first try it was it's your very best try and maybe you just missed them are a little bit and that definitely does happen so I started to take another look at one of my very favorite programs that I currently offer lists builders lab I had to acknowledge ok this program is great people are getting results but it can be better so today I'm breaking down the steps I took to rework that program how I knew it was time to rework how I approach the rework and some other insights and tips and strategies along the way that I want you to keep in mind when you update your online training program before we get there two things you should know about this topic of reworking an online course number one if you don't yet have an online course but you plan to have one in the future for sure or listen to this episode because the insights will add clarity while you're creating your first edition of your course so this episode is a must listen to episode for sure also you can use this episode to rework your services and your offers and the different package is that you have on your website if you do have a coaching consulting service based business so I think there's something for everyone here even if you aren't reworking an existing online course number two if you are creating a course for the first time I highly recommend you either do a beta test before you fully create an bully launcher course or I suggest you test the waters with what I call a pre sell campaign before you create your ends higher course because it's your first time out you're likely wondering what will people actually pay for this so a beta test or some kind of pre sell campaign will answer that question I teach both of these strategies in my program courses that converts if you want to check out a weapon are that leads to the promotion of course is that numbered if you're thinking maybe I need that program in the eighty Porterville da com forward slash courses and it will take you there to sign up for a free master class but again I think a beta tester pre sell campaign are really valuable it's your first time out but here's what this episode is about even after u beta test or even after you test the waters with the pre sell campaign you will still find areas that you can improve on and make better after the first edition of your course is released and if you care about your students which I know you do you'll always be looking for ways to make your horse is better to help your students enjoy the process even more and of course to get bigger results so with that said here's how you rework your online program ok so let's start of the gene which is how do you know it's time to rework an online course or even reworked a service that you offer or a coaching package or whatever it may be how do you know it's time to re work well in my case I have a private Facebook group where all my students get to hold eachother accountable ask questions it's a community and although I'm not active in the group because this is one of my smaller programs and active in my signature programs webinars that number of courses that number but this one I have a community <Music/Noise> and her name is Lindsay so I really had to rely <Music/Noise> Lindsay to keep me updated or people getting to the finish line where they have been challenges what's being discussed and of course I would look over the shoulder in the grouping kind of see what's going on and jump in periodically but I just wasn't a central force in that group so I relied on Lindsey's feedback he didn't injure myself and I just realize wait a second people are talking about their big wins in their big successes they're talking about where they're struggling more than anything in this group even more than my courses program or my webinars program so right there I thought red flag something's going on we've got to pay attention if you have a community where students are talking to each other and you have a platform where they get to ask you questions pay attention to their struggles now in the group that you have people going to talk about their challenges that's normal but they're also going to talk about their small wins in their big wins and if those are few and far between then that might be a red flag now another question that you want to consider is this Do you need to rework your course or just updated so let me give you a re work versus an update it's kind of scenarios see you know what I'm talking about now if you realize that your course just wasn't having the impact that you wanted then it's time to rework it if people are not getting the results that you had expected for them if they're not getting the the course as quickly as you think they should be getting through it like my situation this time to rework also if your students have been confused or frustrated at the very specific points throughout your course it's a very clear that something is stopping them then it might be time to rework that area a real work is not necessarily mean you have to redo the entire program and a reworked is that you're looking at the flow you're looking at the content they're looking a module by module lesson by lesson and making sure that those lessons are going to get people to the finish line with the results that you're promising so sometimes you're just reworking one module or reworking half of the module see you get to decide on that but if there's some frustration at there some confusion that a rework scenario also based on your experiences your insights since you created the first edition of YOUR Corps Navy you've discovered a more proven better way to teach the content maybe you have this huge aha moment that you thought wait a sec and I just realized throughout my own education in my own experiences and diving into the details of my students I can teach this in a way that will get them to the finish line faster and you're not guessing this but you've tried it out you've proven it yourself or with other people so to prove in a strategy and now you're going to incorporate into your program that to rework is WOW now let's shift gears to an up to what is an upbeat look like well let's say you're an industry like minded social media social media is not the only thing I teach but it's part of every single course that I teach and or even worse Facebook ads I mean these things change all the time so sometimes you just need to update portions of your program to keep them in the now so that might be just an update I have to do this constantly when I teach Facebook ads about every three to six months I'm updating some portion of the Facebook ads modules so updates different than rework here's another update if you're gearing up for a new promotion made me want to change out your bonuses from the last time you promoted or maybe want to kind of breathed new life into the program with new updated examples or new case studies that you didn't have the time that you launched it the first time so that's more of an update or if you want to charge a higher price for your program and you decided I'm going to add an extra module or I'm going to incorporate this new feature or this new dude at whatever maybe I'm not sure what it might mean for you but if you want to charge a higher price you have to rework some of the program now just be careful here charging a higher price does not mean you add everything in the kitchen sink to the program to get the price at there something you need to consider and so if you're going to charge a higher price for your program and you want to update the program so that it actually warrants a higher price you definitely have to listen to the podcast episode I did about how to price your online course is episode number one hundred and seven so in the Porterville dot com Ford slashed one zero seven I'll teach you how to actually place your online course if you're looking to raise the price listen to that episode ok so now you know the scenario of reworking versus just updating the program so once you've determined that indeed it is time for a reworked here's the play by play for your next course update there are five steps and these are the exact five steps that I took to rework my entire list builders Lab program so this is what I've done my business and this is what I'm hoping you will do for your next reworked to make it as seamless and stress free as possible ok step number one is to create your rework master doc so a master document I put mine on a Google docs so that I could share it with people that were involved in this process with me like my copywriter my project manager Lindsay my community manager that is my content well if I wanted to get her inside I wanted to be able to easily share this document and have them give me comments and notes so I put in a google doc ever know is another great tool you can use but make sure you put in something that you can share with others if need be so was most important though is for me to help you decide what goes into the reworked master dock and that's what this episode is all about now the first thing you're going to do to create your rework master doc is to create a survey you must survey your existing students even if you don't have a lot of students I'm hoping you hear from the majority of them now what I wanted to do is the freebie for this episode is give you the exact survey questions I asked my list builder lab students because I got me the most amazing feedback that I've ever received in any of the surveys I've ever sent now a huge shoutout to my copywriter Rye Schwartz who I actually have included Rye in the copywriting section of the list builders lab because they teach some copywriting tips and strategies and I brought him a secret weapon right shorts because he's a master but he also helped me create the surveys I just wanted to give him a friendly shout out so we got this survey and again we got such great feedback from it that I thought this would be a valuable freebie for you and I like to give you my hse wif i like to give you what I used my own business and so did your hands on it that's the freebie for this episode all you need to do is go to any Porterville dot com forward slash when it's six six Download Amy Porter Field the home for insight one six six Download order here texture like to get your stuff via text just text the phrase one six six download to the Number three three four four four am and send you the exact questions I asked on the survey but I'm also going to give you little commentary as to why I ask that question a UN to give you some surprising insights I received from asking that question so I just want you to totally steal the exact questions I asked and asked them to your students because they might not be the right question they might not get you the information you need to hear little commentary from me <Music/Noise> ask that question may be a phrase a little bit differently because your programs different their students are different whatever might be so I think you're gonna find this white file as my freebie today really valuable input to fill the com port slash one six six download ok so the first thing I did is I surveyed my students now wasn't enough to send them an email and say Hey fill out the survey the first thing because list builders lab is Evergreen I only send it to people that have been in the program for sixty days or more and in addition to that I sent them an email asking them to fill up the survey twice and then in the private Facebook group I mentioned it multiple times and I gave it about a week so for full week I promoted the survey I said Look I'm looking to rework the program and want to make it exactly what you need to get to the finish line please take just five minutes to fill out the survey so I sent it out everybody and for a full week I promoted it saying hey don't forget to fill it out so I got hundreds of responses which is great because that was really valuable I realize if you don't have a lot of people in your initial program given a survey back from people and you only have twenty people in your program right now might mean that you get five or six pack I get that so the survey might not be the only way to go if you have to get resourceful maybe you get on the phone with some students maybe you do a Q and A with them the salmon to do a live Q A with all of you any question you asked is good to go so you can ask me anything you do the live Q A but then you take the opportunity to get back from them in the moment there's other ways to get feedback but these are pain students here reworking an existing program so you should be able to get some feedback for sure ok so you ascend up the survey you get your feedback now in step one the next thing you do you summarize your survey results now it's not enough for you just to look at the survey results and just kind of make some assumptions I want you to sleep Marie he this survey over a few days like I want you to buy the reason for that is because your brain works in funny ways the first time you might look at some of the results you instantly make a judgment or some kind of assessment but then if you say with a little while you might start thinking of things in a different way I want you to open up your perspective around this thing is they're different reason then or is there a different challenge that may be on the scene Kyrie between the lines and learn something new so here's what I did this was actually really cool project manager Chloe thought of this it wasn't really anything I did but this is what I was able to use Chloe asked Cates who is in charge of customer service and she asked Lindsay has my community manager she asked them both to look at the survey results and just put together a one page review of what they learn from those survey results and Chloe did the same so when I was ready to sit down and analyze the survey I also had three different perspectives and each of them took away something different from those surveys that was really really valuable so if you could have your assistant your virtual assistant if you had someone on your team just look at the survey results and just put together a one pager in terms of what they learned what they thought was happening what stood out to them would be really valuable so that's exactly what I did and <Music/Noise> and I pored over the results We Use Survey Monkey and we use a survey monkey level that allows us to have word clouds which I really like so we're going to get a couple hundred surveys to I think this is valuable but they do word clouds for each question so you can look and say which words we use the most to answer this open ended question and this is really valuable for me to see the words that stick out the most like competence and accountability and struggle and challenge like these are some words that kept coming out that people wanted more accountability and they didn't feel confident their ability to create a lead magnetic stuff like that was coming up the word clouds really made that clear Don't Have to Use Survey Monkey however I think that it is a great tool because high as the Analytics one to get the results are stellar so I highly recommend you use a tool that will tell you some percentages in terms of how people answer the questions I think that's valuable specially going to get a hundred or more responses you want somebody to tally those results for you for Shar arate so moving on here's what I did that I had never done before once I look at the survey results for a pound a day like I have booked the entire day for me to pour over these results day in a little bit deeper and really by midday I started to think OK I see that this is coming up in the survey but I don't know I really understand what they mean or things are coming up in the survey and I thought I wonder if there Colleen yes that will give you an actual example because that's confusing so a lot of people or St I need help with my new subscriber email sequence and then other people or saying I need to know how to create a funnel and many of them were talking about the exact same thing they were calling <Music/Noise> email sequence the same as a final but then I wasn't sure what they meant by final because they were really vague in their responses some people so what I did is I went into the private Facebook group and I said I've got a question for you many of you told me in the survey that you wanted this but does that mean you want this or does it mean this or something else that I'm not thinking about so I clarified some of their response is just a few I think I did this on the re different areas of the survey that I thought I need to dig deeper I really need to understand what's stopping them in their tracks where the staff and I need to understand the language they're using to explain where their stock because this whole idea of finals that everybody was bringing out I wasn't even sure what they were talking about because it looks so can be use in their open ended responses so I just had to get clear and I did it was priceless people were not only answering the questions in the private Facebook group but what was cool as they were thanking me for digging deeper they knew what I was doing because I was very honest that I'm reworking the program and they love that their first hand feedback was going to be actually put into the program so I've taken them on this journey with me and I think they have created an even better bond between us so just wanna throw that out but don't be shy to get some clarification on some questions you might have after you look at the survey results and then one thing that helped me alot as i slept on it so I had so many thoughts and ideas and insights and I came to many conclusions after poring over this day that and then I thought he's asleep on some of this because to be honest I had some books and I talked about this in some of my other private Facebook groups where I was feeling uncomfortable because I have this fly in my personality in it I really do think this is a flaw that I'm very aware of so I work on it that if I see a challenge I instantly go to How do I fix said what steps would I need to take what will it take to make this better instead of just allowing myself to say this is a new opportunity I'm not sure how I'm going to make it work but let's just kind of developed the idea first whereas I cut the idea error rate in half like I don't even get to the total creation of it and I'm already thinking about how my gimmick this war and a lot of the times because I'm a worrier by nature all sort of thing while that's going to work into that whole no you do this is not going to work this is this is the scary ness of living in my mind but I'm aware of this so I just stop myself in my tracks and say No I'm not going to try to solve right now I am going to sleep on it and then in the morning to talk to some my friends about it and that's precisely what I did because once I spent the entire day pouring over these results I did make some assumptions I came to some conclusions and then I called two or three of my friends Rick Moore Eddie was one of them and then two other friends that I said let me run this by you I think is where my students are struggling I'm thinking of teaching the program in this way or that way to fix this problem would you say these are friends that knew my audience while had similar audience is a new list building so they were good people to talk to you so that's exactly how I approach that ok so once I got really clear on the biggest challenge is in what areas I needed to fix and what my students wanted I started to develop the core distinctions major challenges and new insights and I documented all of them in the rework master dock so that over getting back to this master dock and as I'm talking about this and thinking you all are going to find value if I just list all the categories in my master the Oxy don't have to take notes right now so in that freebie I promised you with this survey that I gave these students and also just give you the categories of my master dock in case you wanted to create a similar dock to rework anything in your business day ok so again in the Porterville dock on Ford's last one six six download after the survey questions I ask all put all the categories of the Master to let him run through them with you here again you don't need to take notes but I want you to hear from me so these are some things that I answered in the master back to my students feel before joining the program why did they join the program why had they not completed the course where my students got in stock was some of the negative feedback I had about the course that parts really humbling when my students want more ah I also had a category for additional trains I plan to add additional support I plan to add so as I'm reading the survey responses and I'm getting in the Facebook group I'm reading more of their questions in their comments and all that good stuff I realized okay I am never in this Facebook group I never planned to be an ally but they want me in the group and they're struggling <Music/Noise> to hear from the person that is teaching them so I can't be in the group every single week live on video like I do with my other programs but I can at least be in that group two times a month so right now when I decide it is when I re launch list builders lab every other week I'm going to be in the private Facebook group for probably an hour or less if that's what it takes as long as there's questions all be there and all jump into the private Facebook group into my Facebook Live Q n A which I think is a really great thing to do for your students so I've decided to add that to the mix because I heard too many times that they want to see me in the group now other people ask for things that just were a no go I even ask for stuff that isn't you have to get to them to make sure it fits into your business model your lifestyle your personality so some people ask for things that I'm thinking nope he can do that this is too much this program is at the time is two ninety seven is going to be three ninety seven when I re launch an all talk about the price increase why I decided that he so help you decipher your own course we'll get to that moment but I decided you know this is a cheaper course that I offer and so I can you know do everything give everything for it so I had to be a little bit cheesy in that respect you don't have to give away the fire you don't have to answer every single request that they have in the survey but if you can you can add more support in a different way than by all means during the reworked had in there so again one of my categories was wet rainy and I wanted to add bass on the feedback and also what additional support that I want to add now there is another category called my aha insights and discoveries and I just had some aha moments which you will too when to start to dive into the whole process and here's one of my big aha discoveries that I wanted to share with you guys and that was that I was attracting a lot of people to my program that did not know who their target market was and I knew that to some extent but I didn't know Howell many people I was attracting had no clue who their target audience are their target market Wes and I did a small train inside a list builders lab right at the beginning to address this but they still were stuck and I realize in this is just how I look at my trainings I realized Wait a second I'm not going to add more training inside a list builders lab about finding your target"

before we get there I wanna let you know something that is incredibly exciting and that I've never ever done before and that is that I'm actually opening up the doors to my live and that I'm doing at the end of this year to my general audience now usually <Music/Noise> do as I put on a live event at the end of every year and the only people they get to come to my <Music/Noise> are those that are my B school bonus members order bonus members of other programs like ninety <Music/Noise> since I promoted that last year's while but this time I'm actually opening up the doors to my general audience and you <Music/Noise> to attend this live event as well now tickets are limited for Sher and the name of the event is the entrepreneur experience and already will be there talkin all things Facebook ad has an awesome awesome training planned my business partner Devin Duncan will be there and he's talking about launching I'm going to teach them new content that I've never taught before the I'll bring in <Music/Noise> special guests were stuck on a work in on all of that but it's going to be a great event it's a one <Music/Noise> in San Diego there are two different days October twenty first and December seconds and that cost of the event is nine hundred and ninety seven dollars and seats are limited and the reason they are limited is because all of my bonus members get to secure their spot first so right now the time of this recording they are all secure in their spots and then <Music/Noise> bonus members are going to come I will open the door and have a limited <Music/Noise> of tickets for those that were not part of my bonus experience in two thousand and seventeen so this is the first time that I've done this I'm really really excited and so in about four weeks registration <Music/Noise> bands are using it on the wait list today so if you go to Amy Porter Field dot com forward slash E Vance E V E and T Bass Pro Laurel such a hard word for me to say plural their ego is a little faster in the Porterville dot com forward slash event on the wait list if you're at all interested and then when we go live with the general admission we will for sure <Music/Noise> an email with all the details where it's going to be located in San Diego any information about travel any information about what the day's going to look like but I promise you it's going to be jam packed with the really cool trains but beyond that it's a chance for us to me in person for you to network with some really cool action minded a serious entrepreneur ours at all different levels of UV into new year not too knew there's people just starting out people that have been at it for awhile or even for a long time <Music/Noise> attract a really diverse group to these live events and I always love every minute of it so you are invited if you're interested in getting <Music/Noise> in Porterville dot com forward slash us ok so there you have it now let's get to the good stuff to get checked the dream in and now one question you've got to ask here we go away from the pure gut check into four different categories and the first category is contents and the question is this year have you been creating consistent original content I know some of you are hiding <Music/Noise> or sane shut your mouth the knees stop asking us this week as I know <Music/Noise> of you struggle with showing up weekly on your block or showing up weekly on your podcast or your video show or whatever it might be and I'm definitely here to tell you that you need to be showing up every single week most of my students are creating on line training programs or their coach is our consultants and with that I think in order for you to stand out from all <Music/Noise> on line you've got to have your own original voice that doesn't mean you need to be writing blog posts every single week there are thousands of words it just means that you need to have your own message een you need to do your own mini trains or many insights throughout your content our podcast <Music/Noise> whatever it might be your opinion <Music/Noise> and your audience is looking for a go to source and so if you show up every single week you're going to be out all of your competition so I can't sugarcoat it is incredibly important that you are showing up every single week with original content now in case you haven't listened to it I have a podcast called How to Create content rituals to get more done it's number one hundred and two I have another one called Get your content house in order that's one twenty two going to both of those episodes in the show notes and the reason I'm linking to those is because I know creating consistent original content is not an easy task for most of us and I may try to make it easier for you with those two episodes so that the check number one are you showing up every single week with original content category two leads it's all about growing your email list my question for you is are you growing your email list every single day now every <Music/Noise> mean that you've got ten twenty new leads today but the starts to add up really <Music/Noise> quickly now the way <Music/Noise> that is you stack the opportunities for people to join your email list by stacking I mean it you have a home page freebie something on your homepage of your website that allows people to opt in to get a free audio session of yours a free video <Music/Noise> cheat sheet whatever it might be but then you have some Corner podcast episodes or poor blonde post episodes that you've included content upgrades in them and what I mean by Clinton upgrade is you of what goes in then you have a free beachy she guided blueprint whatever it may be that people can opt into with their name and email in order to get something of great value beyond just the last post you do not need to do this with every piece of content you create but you do want to create a few different posts that you could drive traffic to again and again that included some kind of freebie also if you're getting interviewed on people's podcast or you're getting to guess plot post on someone's why you also want to find a way to include a freebie opportunity where people opt in to get something of great value from you you can mention it on a podcast you can link to it in a blog post but if you are doing any kind of interviews for other people and getting in front of new audiences want to be driving traffic to some kind of freebie so that's just a little snapshot of what it might look like to stack the opportunities to grow your email list if you have a few different lists building opportunities out there makes it a whole lot easier to be lists building every single day to be talking about this whole idea of stacking your list building efforts in a later episode this month but I just wanted to tease that a little bit because it is important but look at your overall list building efforts up until this point in this year how are <Music/Noise> do you feel good about it you feel like you are always finding ways to grow here in Dallas if yes awesome if not it's an area that you want to kind of backtrack and look at what's not working and fix it fix it sooner than later category Number three retention now this very personal to me and <Music/Noise> story what recently happened but the question here before I share my story is are you taking care of the students you have already brought into your community so they've already spent money on your services your products your programs are you keeping them in your community with other opportunities and for me up until recently the answer is not so much because recently we uncovered a problem in my business and hear this I have three programs ever really awesome products we sold it you want to start with list building I have lists builders lab if you're ready to create an online course I have a course creation program called courses that number if you want <Music/Noise> and that's my favorite program it's called webinars that convert so it got a really <Music/Noise> products wheat but was happiness let's say you already bought horses that convert and whether our second verse for me pretty good on this building say don't be my list builders Lab program now was sure I offer some affiliate programs throughout the year but not many and so <Music/Noise> students they have all of my programs or they have as many programs as the need of mine and now they're just kind of <Music/Noise> and we still have challenges that I know I can help them with but I don't have time to create another signature program nor do I see a huge need for it what I see a huge need for is what I am Colleen many trains and recently when I was diving into lists builders lah because I've been redoing the program over the last few months I realize that many of my students that are new in online marketing team they really struggle with finding their target market their ideal customer abit ar this is something that comes up again and again so right away as I dug into the information that my students were giving me I realized this could be its own stand alone mini program doesn't need to be a whole signature program that's a thousand <Music/Noise> dollars it doesn't need to be a program that last sixty days to get through it just needs to be concentrated in deep around one a specific topic that once my students dive in and they figure out some of the challenges <Music/Noise> their target market not only will it enrich every single one of the programs they join that are my programs but also everything they do online so I sat down with my business partner Devon and our project manager Chloe we talked about this and we have come up with an idea to get out of many programs sooner than later so I'm not actually going to spend months and months creating a I'm going to find a way to be nimble <Music/Noise> put together the content more quickly and what I'd done that I think I mean to be able to share with you one how I got out a course a lot quicker than the C sixty or ninety days which typically is needed when I'm creating a signature course but it's just a mini train whether you want it to use it just to get your course creation started or are you see a need in your audience but it's not a huge program is just one specific area I can't wait to share with you how I do it and then teach you how I did it so that will be a great podcast episode with us and the more so anyway I bring this up but I think I've already talked about this on another podcast so I'm bringing up again to let you know that when you look at the category retention in your business how are you supporting the students that you've already attracted into your world you might need to think a little bit differently you might not need a whole nother big program to support them but maybe you do maybe you want to create a mastermind or group coaching or some kind of VIP experience to take those people that you've already attracted you are the hard work now well let's take them into an area where you <Music/Noise> you can help them whether it's horizontal or vertical you can figure out how that works and your products we I think there's some opportunity there and just as a side note one side you the target market many program I get tons of ideas of others that I'd like to try out as well so if you're looking for some new content from me my friend is coming your way ok so we already went over category when content category two leads category three retention category for revenue this one is a big one because if you are not checking in on your revenue than you're actually not sure at all if you are on the right track now just a little sigh know as to what <Music/Noise> business I actually have a bookkeeper I will link to my bookkeeper in the show notes because I've used her from day one and <Music/Noise> they're called good sense but a link to the actual website in my <Music/Noise> but every single month they give me my piano now so I am very clear how much we spent how much we've made and a lot more details just a kind and dive into what's working what's not working so it's really important that at this point at least you know how much you've brought in gross and that and then I take a really good close look at your expenses most people are spending <Music/Noise> more money than they need to in their business and at one point in my business I looked at all the different subscriptions in tools that I was pain for that I wasn't <Music/Noise> ISIS started to say a few hundred dollars a month just by clean up the reoccurring charges on tools that I thought I would need in my business that I haven't even touched her right away that's one area <Music/Noise> look at expenses to be close attention to but just in general I want you to look at the money coming in the money going out this is <Music/Noise> time to reassess if you don't have a bookkeeper need to do it yourself by all means do so one of the tools that I highly recommend is fresh bucks so you can look into fresh folks a link to it in my shirt as well and that might be really great place to start especially happy invoice people and you want to track your revenue in your expenses and fresh folks might be really good solution for you but I think it's important for you to sit down as soon as possible just look at the revenue because it really does paint a very big great picture as to if things are working or maybe if they're not and it's time to re evaluate before you get too much into the second part of the year and it's too late to re evaluate and maybe make some hits ok so now we went through the categories content needs attention and revenue now it's time to do a little dream team so let's do it the injury mean I have four different questions I want to ask yourself before we get there I wanted to tell you about my friend Annika now I see she's my friend but I actually never met her it's been a long time since I've had a girl crashed but I'm pretty sure this is girl crush caliber here's Danica gracious in how you say her last name I'm terrible with stuff like that I watched so many of her videos she never says her last name but it is the founder of model meals and you guys have probably heard me in rectum already talk about model meals and meal delivery service that is a maze seen in its whole thirty comply and it is just incredible I did every single week AI and I was looking over Danica s website and she does a lot of mourning rituals and so if you ever want to read about her morning rituals all lead to it in the show notes but when I was reading n here's my point to this whole story as I was reading her morning rituals in one thing she dies is a daily biography of herself in her dream life so she thinks about all the things that she wants to create maybe for her business her personal life she really <Music/Noise> some serious dreaming about the future and then she does a daily biography of herself in her dream life says Yoo writes about her life in the future now even <Music/Noise> she does a journal entry from her future to get herself feel lean how that life would feel like she does a little biography and then she does an actual journal entry as though she were in the future not some intense staff but Danica has changed her life dramatically <Music/Noise> from where she was to where she is now in all areas of her life so when I see people had major success in major transformation I don't <Music/Noise> intense ness said a word of what they do <Music/Noise> daily rituals in order to create the life they have instead I look at that and I am just incredibly impressed so this is something that I've recently added to the max of the things I do not <Music/Noise> basis I'm not really good journaling every day but two or three times a week I can do that so this is something I've just recently adopted so I cannot am a huge success at it just yet it's brand new for me but I absolutely love it so far so we're talking about dreams looking at your future self Journal lean as though you are in the future in your dream life I don't see anything wrong with that one as long as you're staying present taking action every single day and looking toward the future I mean bring it on other ways that people love to dream is through vision <Music/Noise> and I've definitely done that is while they're so cool to look back on in realize all the things that actually came to fruition based on what you visualized <Music/Noise> on your vision board so I know you guys know many different ways that you can look into the future and you can dream Bay I just want to encourage you in the next forty <Music/Noise> to take it Luis to one hour to just dream big however you want to dream you can do it the way Danica does it you can vision board you can do anything that you want to take a walk and think about what's possible but the reason <Music/Noise> impress upon you the importance of taking an hour in the next forty eight hours is because I don't dream enough I put my head down I get into the work and I forget to think about what's possible what good can I put into this world beyond what I've done so far what can I create what's possible with the business of my life I just don't spend enough time in the space and so if you're anything like me you get great next forty eight hours one hour allow yourself to do some dreamy and then take some notes so you know what it is that you want to create so first I want you to do that but then <Music/Noise> I want you to answer these four questions and this is way today's freebie is all about to walk you through in the freebie the actual four or get checks and then these four airy as to allow yourself to start planning for your future do a little dreamy and then actually making it happen so be it freebie today is really really simple it is basically forgot checked the four ways to dream and oh ok so here you go number one what one big lead you're <Music/Noise> for the second half of the year with one big leap you're going to make so if you've already made a bold move this year that I feel like you're covered if you feel like you're on the right track and you might not need to make another bold move but you need to focus more on list building or maybe you need to figure out retention or whatever that might be then by all means spend your time there but if you haven't done something Bowl this year now is the tie if you haven't listened to the very first episode I did this year it was called something around bold moves it was at the September one forty two I had the title and I didn't but it is episode number <Music/Noise> and forty two all linked to in the show notes and I actually outlined ways to make bold moves in your business I wanted you to choose just one if you haven't done that yet you still have time of the rest of the year to do it another reason why you want to make these bold moves is we can stay comfortable we can't get all <Music/Noise> and fuzzy and cozy in our biz ness If we want to keep moving forward and keep creating amazing things he got <Music/Noise> uncomfortable it's got to fill little awkward at times and then you get past that it's smooth sailing for a while and then <Music/Noise> he got to get uncomfortable I feel like that's the only way to do business as an entrepreneur to let me tell you you all heard that I've been creating <Music/Noise> studio right in talking about it online a bunch probably <Music/Noise> in the podcast but I spent a lot of money to create a video studio in my home office and it is a big deal I'm in there right now but my podcast equipment still isn't set up properly until next week and so on this audio actually my sound different than my traditional audio but regardless of that and looking around there's two different cameras there's like six different lights there's trust seen in years are like big metal poles and all that good stuff and it makes me very nervous I am <Music/Noise> at all comfortable in this new video studio I just feel like delights our hots this is a smaller room I normally do video from downstairs in my big living room and I use natural lighting but the reason that didn't work is because if I wanted to do a video at six pm that went out the window and the camera angle was right the lighting <Music/Noise> great it just got really stressful and I wanted to go pro with my videos and so it was time in my business to do this putting together the video studio made me uncomfortable sitting here in this video studio recording my videos doing or weekly live show on my Facebook page right now all of that makes me incredibly uncomfortable but I'm still going to show up and do it because this is how I stretch myself and how I move my business forward and I'm gonna test it out I may change things down the road I might not love having <Music/Noise> I don't know I've got to try and that was my big bold move for two thousand and seventeen a video show on my Facebook page every Thursday and also creating a next level video studio for me to really be pro in what I'm doing so that's my able move and yes right now I'm sweating bullets and I'm really uncomfortable with it but I <Music/Noise> make my way through it I always do same for you what your bold move don't be afraid to get uncomfortable number two after you decide your big bold move if you haven't done it yet number two what one small change you're going to make because every bold move starts with just one small shift or one small change so what is that going to look like for you I just wanted you to think about what's one thing you can do to get the ball rolling and then move into something day you might not need a small shift but if you do I want you to explore that it's going to propel you into the next big thing and number three What is your second half of the year Mon tra and maybe listening to this later so it's be on the second half of the year it doesn't matter what is your macho right now to move your business forward to be quite honest when I was preparing this for you I thought I'm not sure what my monitor is and so I promised myself I will have my mom tripped out before this episode goes live so the morning that this episode goes live I've got a jump on in stories or Facebook Live or something and I got to share with you my <Music/Noise> and then I'll say go listen to this episode so you can share your monitor with me as well but I think is important that we are repeating something to ourselves over and over again when my friends she is fearful right now in her business because she's just starting out so every decision she makes every move she makes she just fills fearful about it so her Monterrey now in this season of her business is a life lived in fear is a life half lived so everytime she does something she feels herself kind of clammy nap or her heart beating faster sweating <Music/Noise> a decision she thinks a life lived in fear is a life half lived so it's something that you can just repeat yourself over and over again when you see your old patterns creepy men some of the mine to share with you the morning this episode goes live I want you to think about yours and holy cow I would love to hear it so come over to my Facebook page where I post about this episode the morning it goes live and post your mantra I would love love love to hear let share with each other now the fourth question is What are you most excited about right now in your business so if I would ask that only speak aloud if you're somewhere we're not going to look crazy by talking to yourself What are you most excited about right now in your business I wish I could hear you so very badly because I'd love to hear what you have to say but here's the thing when it comes to my business when I'm most excited about is that many program I told you about not just the topic of finding your target market but I'm excited to create something new and to do it in a <Music/Noise> quick efficient manner and to try some new technology as we roll <Music/Noise> I guess just going to be different than anything I've done before and I'm excited to try some different stuff what are you most excited about now I also want to share with you one little thing before I even allowed to touch that knew many products I have to get done with a big project that I've been working on for a while which is revamping list builders lab now I'm excited to revamp list builders lab and I'm deep into it right now but if you told me I could be done with that and move on to this new exciting project right now I'd be like Hallelujah but I can't I meet him in to my students to rework this program I've been telling <Music/Noise> my teams working on it so and let them down if I just push that to the wayside so you've gotta respect your word you've got to respect yourself and your team and your clients and whatever you're working on right now get it done before you move on to that next thing that you are so very excited about now you're lucky if that thing you're working on right now is what you're most excited about but typically as entrepreneurs we always have one step into the next big thing that we can't wait to get our hands on but the entrepreneurs that are most successful are those that do not allow themselves to go there until they finish what they're working on now and that is my My biggest wish for you that you finish what you're working on now and then <Music/Noise> to what you're most excited about ok so I <Music/Noise> to that they got chat and that little <Music/Noise> want you to do but now my final thing that I want to share with you what I promised at the very beginning of this episode is I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to honestly answer it is even just answer right now in the moment and then we're going to talk about it and the question is this what are you doing in your business right now that you dread what are you doing here is that you hate doing that you think about it and you're like ahh gross I don't want to do that at all we all have these things in our business there's <Music/Noise> you can tell me that you love every single thing you're <Music/Noise> what's one thing that you absolutely hate so all share mine and then you have to promise to think of yours as well for me I mean there's a few things that I don't like to do <Music/Noise>"

right Jerry Rowley cute this is the stuff you should know <Music/Noise> I just try new stuff I mean we're coming up on a thousand episodes and get to keep it for somehow so I tried a team you've actually done that like seventy six times the same one that's probably true though if you received what seemed would you be I would be a pumpkin seed oh wow yeah you know you won't get eaten oh no I like pumpkin pie so well and people toast pumpkin seeds so yeah I'm way off base there what the CIA are mine no pumpkin seed them I would be a <Music/Noise> seed because they remind me of my grandfather it's sweet how to grow the seamless hormones to eye your watermelon seed you should know or the square ones yeah those are cool too they cost like sixty dollars in Japan really Yeah there is expensive I would have won just have that I would like show lack it so it would never die right and just keep him her fridge for conversation bees it's not a bad idea man or actually take that back I'm gonna start marketing fake square watermelons as conversation starters or refrigerator magnets shaped like square watermelons what about that and there's a viable space and to think all that running running something into the ground yeah um I've got something for you to you in the food fads episode asked me what my go to crock pot recipe was and I told you and I was like okay moving on and I upon listening to it because another minus is enough for you and I owe all listen to the episode injury before really Sumter and I was like I didn't s took with his cock pot recipe was the suck they didn't what is your go to crock pot recipe Oh wow well you know it is no I don't it's not um not say what is it is a turkey goulash a surprise to see just some ground turkey and some onion and green pepper and red pepper and all manner of spices and you can also throw in like eggplant or squash or you know kind of any vege veggie like that just sounds good and just spice it up real good throw in that crock pot maybe a little chicken broth or something and to have turkey broth yes they do okay sure will then be Oh no I don't think chicken broth would clash with Turkey to bed but yeah probably taken both of the better well you may not know something in your mouth might be disturbing in use like something's not quite right so what's the surprise they using chicken broth in a Turkey based this was it like a human thumb this case I tried the thumb but twice if it is only two thumbs and got another surprise is our lentils oh yeah this is nicer than the dump a bunch of lentils in there maybe you could vote on their beginning if you get can really go she but maybe toward the end though some lentils in there and then it all just cooks up to big kind of soupy mass and you can eat it for a week well the next time there's a house for its weekly book club meeting you've gotta bring that to the potluck okay alright because i wanna try done our lentil seeds because of the Grace a way but I'm almost a hundred percent sure that I would be wrong in saying Well lentils or see I think it's a Lagoon is a Lagoon <Music/Noise> a Laguna seed well you didn't ask me that I don't have any idea although they are protecting the goons in seed banks okay okay probably the seeds but pretty close so use that as a Segway have of that yet and you know what's funny is we could have sworn that we did this one or the very least the doomsday vault and I think we cover the doomsday vault in a video but we we did touch on it and will the moon save humanity yeah that's a good one but went back this one had transcripts it was a funny one to read because we brought it up without researching it off the top of her head which always gets in trouble and just sort of chatted a minute about the doomsday vault and then said You know don't hold this to anything because we'd this wasn't supposed to be a part of the show so we didn't really cover it no we certainly didn't do a whole episode on the right know and we're not going to this time because even though the doomsday vault better known as the small solve our global seed bank which is in small bar Norway which is close too long you'll be in Norway which is the closest town to the North Pole right now this seed bank is hands down the most famous seed bank in the entire world is run by techno Kratz really know how to work the media right yeah but it's far from the <Music/Noise> other seed banks out there and even the hosts a concert to see banking in general is pretty interesting so Fall Barn will be the star for a band of B C Banks featuring the stylings of small bar global seed bank that's probably should be than Tyler's a cutesy featuring the stylings of small barred Goldstein and that sounded like of like a small time magician that spray or an accordion act Julia could stuff them all right let's get to it this one by the way was written by my friend Debbie my notice the member Debbie Debbie wrong to my body from New Jersey yeah and supplemental material he found a really great article on the doomsday vault is that from the Guardian or yeah those by <Music/Noise> seizing Goldberg in The Guardian from May two thousand and fifteen yeah that's one of my favorite kinds of articles is when they profile sumthing n then it set up is like you know the sun rises early <Music/Noise> in and then gets out of his yurt and stretches across the Glacier and so it's sort of couch to the story of the the duty works are one of the guys yeah then you get all the deets along the way very cool yeah that's that's called a long read her long form yet and actually there's two really great sites once called long form in one's called Long read once and I come once a day or you can never <Music/Noise> which but if you like that kind of writing this all those sites are just page after page after page of links to articles like that yes and in fact our buddy Joshua Baer been a great writer of long form his own little single called at that magazine if you're looking for and like those really great basically people mind that site to make movies they're such good stories yes well he wrote the magazine article that far in the Fargo Argo Ben Affleck movie was based on yeah pretty cool the funny part about that so that is the Coen Brothers at the beginning of Fargo say like this is based on a true story which is not true at all right he also wrote a really great one um about a California surfer gang to smuggle pot of like Lauren <Music/Noise> in the seventies and it is just begging <Music/Noise> if it hasn't been yet I think its options surely it is <Music/Noise> high right or not <Music/Noise> and I'm pretty sure Barron wrote the second like two dozen thirteen says the unit yes a put down your streaming TV shows for god sake and I would say read a book for the very least read a long form article yet I can get on a soapbox for a second well the seas eventually raises because I so the whole concept of there being TV everywhere <Music/Noise> you can take TV to the beach now have to talk to anybody you can like watch TV on the subway that's that's that bothers me Chuck bothers me like to my core I know that makes me very unpopular okay I stand with us I mean I've been listening we've been sitting around in a room at night together in silence and listening to S town oh cool which I've forgotten how fun it is to listen to podcasts on my own like my car but just to sit around like with your loved one and listen to something this kind of neat do yes some may look and be like Oh please write but everybody thinks we sit around listen to podcasts together we do you believe that in IRC Bangsar yes so Debbie rocker makes a really great point that you think of seed banks as this probably something new from the environmental movement yet probably something from the <Music/Noise> maybe as far back as that but she says not to see banks or a concept as old as agriculture basically that in the in the cradle of Agriculture Mesopotamia which is present day Iraq they have found seed banks as old as eighty seven hundred and fifty years so um this in stores back then were protecting the seas from animals from whether that kindness of pretty basic stuff right the concepts the same it's that you need seed from one harvest to create the next harvest and so even back then there is evidence those highly rich allies collecting seeds and then protecting them in in important places yeah and the weather is certainly something that we are still guarding against the extremists one of the reasons we've we have seen banks today but one of the main reasons is crop diversity if you think the corn you're eating is just corn or rice or eating is this rice or even you now bahs Mahdi rice or Jasmine rice for or to the big two for sushi rice to be in for big surprise if you knew that there were thousands and thousands of varieties of all of these crops the staple crops and diversity is the key because we've seen throughout history when bad things happen when there's blight with that there's a fungus if there's anything that can kill a crop you want something that is diverse on your hands he can try something new I remember in the famine episode where we talked about how one of the reasons that Ireland suffered so tremendously it was because the potatoes they had were all basically the same throughout the whole country was the same variety of potatoes right so in that potato blight came it was there was a pathogen that all of the potatoes in Ireland were susceptible to where if they had had multiple varieties of potatoes sure a lot of the potato varieties would have been wiped out but there would have been some that survive to use all that was whose English well enough to make anything easier on them if I remember correctly no of course but I was poking fun but the idea that there are tons and tons of different varieties other there certainly are but if you take a another order of magnitude step back and look at the global food system is really like thirty crops that make up basically all of the food supply right yeah and that's the seabed thirties find we can survive on just one really scary though the problem is if you go the opposite direction and zoom in a little further those crops are fairly Hamas denies these days and it's thanks to our buddy Norman bore law norm sure so he fathered the Green Revolution in large part which was there were a lot of predictions that the world's carrying capacity was going to be reached by the nineteen sixties and that of a billion people were going to starve to death now is because the agriculture that we had the time was capable of producing only so much crop yield so Norman bore log took it upon himself to say I'm going to save the world and he came up with these new techniques and new varieties of crops and said Here this variety is going to get you way better yields they can survive flooding it can survive drought go plant this in his has varieties that the bread was so successful number <Music/Noise> Prize in him is widely credited for saving possibly a billion lives with his work but secondly it was so successful that it became basically the only varieties of those crops that were planted in the seventies here in the United States we came to sue running smack dab into what a problem that can be when this corn blight hit those big fungus in the seventies and and say what I wanted to say when it cut the corn yields in United States in half and luckily we did have some more varieties at our disposal we had a relative of a wild corn just crazy pain and it was fungus resistant so in that case we are able to save the day which is kind of the whole point of crop diversity in seed banks is to have something on hand in case the worst case scenario happens so all your your potatoes aren't in one basket or all your corn is in one basket so they literally in a And with that corn by Tuesday we learned the hard way something like one quarter to one half of the corn yields in the United States were lost during the seventies it was because something like I think eighty percent of the corn being grown <Music/Noise> was identical in this way that the corn blight could to manipulating tell so we've said all we need to diversify a little more is a hard lesson learned but it was a lesson learned since then this idea like a set of crop diversity has become more more important in people said well we'll start banking seeds so we can protect that the genetic line and protect varieties from dying out in the meantime yeah and so that some universities big deal climate change is another reason we bank CD's because we're not certain what's going to happen in the future with the weather actually not with the weather climates different things they say natural disasters like tsunami or really kind of any kind of natural disaster could cause great harm to crop yield right or disease which you would think would be considered a natural disaster too well now it's disease got to get to delineate here you are <Music/Noise> made disaster in the Point example the visas here is a war which yeah you really think about war but there have been and as you'll see even with seed banks during times of war especially the Middle East a lot of the seed banks in the Middle East have been looted and raided during war so that sort of compounds the problem plus also one of the other things that war does is come up roots populations right you have to move because there's a war going on in your town and you can't live there anymore so if you're a farmer you may never go back to farming <Music/Noise> may be one of the few indigenous people who are farming a specific variety of something and now that variety is lost forever because you moved and stopped farming and there's there's that can happen in more <Music/Noise> pedestrian ways to wear say a family that's farming in indigenous variety of crops um just moves to the city for better work or something like that to find a way that she lists is on that we my twenties seed bank is for research in the future plant based medicine has always been around one in every six while plants is used for medicine and we don't know I mean we we know so very little still about the uses of plants for medicine so we don't want to wipe out something that could be the cure for cancer one day Ryan I kind of like the cornerstone of the idea of seed banks these days is that we need to take the seeds from every plant we can get our hands on today every variety we can get a hands on and just store it just basically put him in suspended animation in the under the idea that eventually because of climate change or because of war or because we may figure something out in the future in need those plants or need access to their genetic information and so we have the seeds stored away in suspended animation Norman then we will say thank you pple hundred years earlier for being so smart as to create seed banks that's right thousands of years earlier in fact maybe maybe but there's problems we see banks as well talk about you and take a break jealousy that will get to that the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> uh <Music/Noise> uh you know my

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> right so as far as what kind of seeds are chosen at the pins I mean there are more than fourteen hundred are right around fourteen hundred seed banks in the world so I know so far bald for both of our Walmart I really think you can see the way I know if you want to say he like it sounds like a dude from there it does use in dealing Viking metal he gets all the coverage of our guys so I lost all the seeds there about four hundred seed banks though all over the place and it depends on which one you're talking about really is to what kind of seeds they're going to preserve smaller seed banks are probably going to concentrate more on more local indigenous varieties it seems like in all cases any kind of the endangered plant is probably looked after him first yeah they tend to take priority from what I understand but there's a great group called the Global crop diversity Trust and their whole jam is to concentrate on priority crops that are that benefit everyone <Music/Noise> the most so those of the people they run small barred him from what I understand they've kind of come in and said we we are we're going to be setting the standards for seed preservation in the world now someone had to yeah and there's a <Music/Noise> in The Guardian <Music/Noise> one of the founders of this trust and one of the I think he was the first director of the small bar Global seed vault the same scary Fowler's from Tennessee and he said we didn't create this seed bank to prevent this catastrophe coming with like climate change where all the doomsday vault you know Right right it was and but again I think the media Thailand Sunday that he was saying the original intent with why they founded the Small Bar C Ball was because the currency banks were doing such a terrible job of keeping their season like alive are in tact we were losing varieties every day from ones that were sort of seed banks there is going away so is basically like limeade to it he's like a dyed in the I T guy well it is kind of scary though like when we talked with when he was interviewed he was to say like you know nuclear war was our biggest threat is under funding and sloppy work right or yeah budget cuts um malfunctions in the equipment like badly maintained equipment there's a lot of something go wrong with the seed bank is so so the point behind the small barred seed bank is to serve as a backup repository where yeah you keep your scenes there in your country and will show you the best ways to manage your seed bank but also put a duplicate set with us and we're just going to keep it stored when I can do the science or anything like that the whole point of the small bars seed bank is just keep it stored under the right conditions so that <Music/Noise> it it will be here for you that is correct so this global diversity crop trust they work under a treaty called the International Treaty on Plant genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture or burger for and it was ratified in two thousand and four by forty different governments imagine since and probably some more on board right I believe so though <Music/Noise> much um that has kind of falling to the wayside since crop just created this small bird seed of all they see new kind of taken over from what I understand well I mean I think this treaty is just it's part of good practices too yeah you know Yeah so what they do is they they do permit access for the seeds for research and stuff not from small market like we said that's that's the bank that doesn't allow withdraw but it has to be of benefit to everyone basically can't just go Willy nilly on a whim and pull seeds out and start experimenting right well that's the that's that's for the other seed banks that's kind of like the process where those are the ones that they're keeping so that somebody can come in like grow some stuff and check out the genetic material of the plants or whatever small bar it's like you put it in it stays there and you can get out but is only you the deposit or that has access to correct and so apparently that was they agreed to that or they set up that rule only the group or the country that put those seeds in the small bars vault can get them out because there's <Music/Noise> they were creating the global seed vault that the whole thing was basically just a ruse for big agriculture to get their hands on heirloom seeds from around the world in which I mean I can understand next from what I understand the big agriculture seed companies are fairly shady yeah we should do an episode just on that chair a lovely email so if you go <Music/Noise> to one of these banks then again they're not they're all can be very different they are the same concept to heart and I think that when W's is an example was from the Department of Environment and Conservation in Australia um like I said the kind of all operate in a similar fashion we first need to do is to decide how much room you have in what seeds you want to collect to begin with right we mention priority goes to threatened plants obviously first and foremost but the again dissolve are their whole mission is to to preserve every bit of the crop diversity of the global crop supply which day Cary Fowler dude says is about one point four million varieties and last I saw they were coming up on <Music/Noise> think they had like nine hundred and forty thousand varieties in their in their care correct so once you've decided which uni then you're in your little local seed vault seed bank do collect seeds it seems like the most obvious place to start and win when vegetables and fruits are ripe this is probably the best time to collect and store the seeds as fruits they release their seeds when they arrive so that usually works out pretty well but then you know kind of ends of the plant some plants don't give up their seed so readily so I can be getting a bad thing maybe <Music/Noise> time to retain their seeds which allows for a longer collection time but you know if you're in the position you know when the best time is to get the seed from each plant sure and then when you're collecting it you're also making notes of the soil quality and type the growing conditions the ecosystem like an ecosystem is growing an important part almost besides the seed it's extremely important we read this one article that just the one from Barry they very point you know the one in Portland very Botanic Garden on to add something extra but they they basically had a rundown of how they do it and they were saying important record keeping is about as important as having the seat itself because you don't have the information you need including what kind of seed is where this is basically useless as far as the bank is concerned well it was a useless but you'd certainly have to grow it and take those records and kind of start over in this field why his Hawks record all this information again assigned a sample number very specific number obviously for that seed so everything is you know the the record keeping is a huge huge part of it so you know what everything as units of mixed up in case of a nuclear apocalypse suck so bad really wait a minute we may have the we in my left hand I think just think or we thought we were growing corn but we're going papaya from an eleven a party actually that would be so bad now let's all you have a party trick is you be like oh those can be poured in it"

pasta shift love the you like tomato soup it <Music/Noise> don't love it I'll choke it down though some certainly suspects emerge here oh yeah I don't go for raw tomatoes much well love cooked pasta sauce yeah and the minis guy at heart so for talking condiments you know one thing about the the degree to affect the kind of ruined me a little bit on food will be like this is a good tomato and some part of my brain's like I was not nineteen forties tomato or tomato is like a Jersey tomato versus a no to some other stupid to know supposedly like just the agricultural production in the US is so Hamas denies now that like we've lost all these great heirloom varieties of gotcha especially tomato in the stuff that most people get the tomatoes just know there are no good compared to how they used to be the head of the Farmers Market sure that even still the judge herself and he gave Orrville The Time Machine take the way back machine and it's again a week at our disposal to what your problem scientists chief only to spend on gas than was fine chocolate you like man is because did you know that you know before this I should say that the number one condiment for sales wise in the United States is Manning's I did not know that in when I saw that that surprise me a surprise maybe that was that much more than catch up I figured ketchup would be far away the winner because I always feel like the ultimate weirdo for not liking catch up so what is it about cats you know that ace to give reason not to like I'm not wild about vinegar base things oh yeah I do like balsamic vinegar but a lot of the other vendors I'm not crazy about that's one of the reasons I don't like pickled things right but it's a vinegar base things it's really sweet and then I don't love the sweet condiments I have ever had curry ketchup no leakage of I O C and then the one I was a kid I can't lie probably gross me out a little bit because the entire mom <Music/Noise> in it oh it's the serving in the blood thing in our probably thought you know that gross me out because we would use his blood for play acting and things yet so yeah just not into it those are some solid reasons to now I catch a plus I don't know if people probably argue that catch them and these are great together but once you're on the mayo train to mix up another condiment with that just doesn't make sense to me I I don't I don't discriminate I like most if not all condiments like ketchup mayo and mustard on burgers good to you yes movie I can't can't can't eat it without it like I've actually found and I can eat burgers without cats have now grown up but I do like a little bit tentative on a little bit of mustard and yes definitely ma'am Lim Lee loves catch up so much that she calls french fries ketchup delivery system yeah makes sense or vehicle for and tell her to try curry ketchup I will knock your socks off I totally will um yeah but you don't like as if the UN like this but she likes ketchup even if she doesn't like curry she may still like Eureka to Owens in the curry ketchup so man is is the Number one economy in the United States it's a big surprise which must mean cats have his number two which by the way mentioned how much more I think it was about two billion dollars to eight hundred thousand <Music/Noise> dollars which is more than double that kind of surprising yet is very surprising what's even more surprising as being facetious because cats have isn't even <Music/Noise> two economy in the United States also has its rights also a big surge in the eighties and nineties it's because people like to say so I will drive its ketchup is number three right mustard be for Pete's sake what is the EU <Music/Noise> yet ninety seven percent of American households have a bottle of ketchup in their wells as kitchens but we'll get to the fridge non fridge thing later sure so yes everybody loves cats especially in America because it's obviously an American invention everybody knows that John Wayne's grandfather invented catch up while he was sailing his Ford truck down the Mississippi River and one day magical bottle of Budweiser team and whisper the skin is here and they commemorated <Music/Noise> event by shooting off fireworks I love it that sarcasm was born <Music/Noise> and fireworks pretty neat no that's not true although I take a little bit of issue with this because ketchup was first created in Asia and China in about five forty four CE I should say I saw the thing maybe the Chinese got it from the Vietnamese yeah so it is okay but as you will see these recipes that were originally for preserving fish it's a they didn't have tomatoes at all that came in an America much later but it's not like ketchup to me it's you can even trace it back and say like yup that's catch up to the point in even linking these things because you can link them like it's that's the fascinating thing to me about it's like American ketchup what we think of his cats appear in the States like Heinz fifty seven stuff right is it's a species that evolved not Heinz fifty seven sauce behind schedule ok what everybody thinks of his catch a ferry it's a species that evolved from an ancestor that that is you can directly trace its lineage right back to the sketch have been in Asia so much so that the word ketchup is an Anglican causation of either <Music/Noise> word was borrowed from the candies or a hokey in south China's Fujian province word either way it was something like cats you and give meant fermented fish paste it's like when you go to the store today and you buy fish sauce yet love it that's that's that was that's the presenter of ketchup that's where catcher came from yeah I mean I guess that makes sense is to me it's changed so much it's almost like you should just draw a <Music/Noise> that's been I guess that line would be pre tomato in posts tomato I think yeah I think this pretty fair to say yeah priests made on posts made to unify jaw line because if you look at Heinz ketchup bottles it says clearly tomato ketchup now and there's this really great because if ass co design article by gunning John Brownlee who points out like why would they even bother putting tomato <Music/Noise> of course is tomato ketchup you idiot and the reason is because that's a throwback to a time when I didn't have tomato in it had things like sardines and anchovies sardines by anchovies or sardines you name it it was probably in cats but some point right so Asia maybe Southeast Asia maybe China and the Brits encounter this on some of their wild trips abroad and as many things brought it home said We love this stuff let's try and replicate it and then in seventeen thirty two was one of the first publish recipes in the UK ketchup been paced by Richard Bradley right Bradley Rickie rally and he did reference the East Indies as its origin yeah feel free to make sure it was a very pretty a faithful re creation of the fish sauce that they found the cats you um I'm pretty sure that I say it would be very interested to now to pronounce it correctly but there was was a faithful re creation of it which was basically like preserve fish in a sort of brine with some spices thrown in maybe a little Mace some salt some pepper or maybe something like lemon peel and in theory yes if you like fish sauce you would love the original catch up because basically the same thing right well I do like the sauce but it's time to use it liberally in its only for certain things yeah yeah you know er you know it is like a stone fish sauce on everything I don't know man a few little fish sauce it's like to people put the buns and anything to do that so so at first the Brits are like blind me this is really good stuff this good accent but I mean I'm not that big on anchovies what else can we replace it with so they started making their own kind of off shoots of catch up where they replace the anchovies with other stuff yeah I mean mushrooms walnuts <Music/Noise> what else elderberry young oysters yeah and what they were going for was that Mommy flavor then noted that I'm his mommy was and is given to what the sixties I think yes these are shown yeah everybody kind of knew <Music/Noise> was a thing but no one actually likes us another named it right that so they're going for is this savory <Music/Noise> flavor you get from something like fermented anchovies and they're trying to recreate it and they did I mean like apparently mushroom ketchup tasted alot like worst dish or sauce pan and then Walnut ketchup apparently Jane Austen was a big fan of that if you're sitting there thinking of putting this on like your hot dog hot dogs weren't invented yet the people were using for their <Music/Noise> is like a base for stews yeah or like meat pies things like that there's a case sauce it was a base it was something that you are taking bland food in making a savory with his bottle of the stuff that was made from fermented something or other well and they would base it on <Music/Noise> they would use it like we can ease BBQ sauce base it on things while they're cooking for them which artists can imagine that like pasting to made a vase well this is before us tomato yes but right this is when those mushroom base yeah but you mention Mommy and your buddy Malcolm Gladwell article for The New Yorker and kind of throwing out the question like Why are there so many kinds of mustard ketchup is kind of catch up in his answer was because it satisfies all the fundamental Tay saw five sweet salty sour bitter and you Mommy another answer is that there actually are a ton of different kinds of cats well yeah this is Ben is there are mustard so America is to first because tomatoes are native to North America and this is where people first started using tomatoes the base yeah but Chuck took a really <Music/Noise> circuitous route to get to that point and the reason why as in America people are making cuts of that they were still doing things like using walnuts and using mushrooms and oysters as the base of it right yet they still are using tomatoes even the tomatoes were everywhere and that was because Europeans and American colonists or European colonists considered tomatoes poisonous so they didn't eat tomatoes something I think they use them is like ornamental plants or something like that finally some people started to like try a man trying to convince other people and then they went through a little period where they're considered medicine and finally somebody started adding onto to catch up and the first tomato ketchup recipe appears in an American cookbook depending on who you ask either in eighteen twelve or eighteen o one yet eighteen twelve one <Music/Noise> well yeah that's when I found was eighteen twelve but it still didn't really really take off until post Civil War and this is eighteen seventy <Music/Noise> a man named Henry Hines he got together with a doctor that right yes that guy Doctor Wiley member's first name but he shows up in our FDA does as does the FDA protect Americans remember that guy who put together that group of people who would like to eat preservatives until they were poisoned to find out whether something was poisonous or not yes that was the guy who set up that squad yet Doctor Harvey Washington Wiley yeah so his whole deal was for for while their ketchup was had some really nasty chemicals in it some of them had and these are all preserved in some of that was coal tar that gave it the red color and sodium bins owe it to wait Anna and that helps to retard spoil it so it was really nasty stuff and he kind of first championed this stuff is harmful to your health so he got together with Henry J Heinz who was producing catch up in eighteen seventy six and they were like You know what if you use really good because at the time to catch it they were making was from my scraps of tomatoes are kind of like junk tomatoes and they said you know if use good ripe red tomatoes as your base it has a natural preservative in it called pectin and it really got a branch of the vinegar because that'll help out with a spoiler gentleness and we don't need these chemicals anymore right which is a huge breakthrough and the reason why there's so many preservatives in catch up was because tomatoes have a pretty short growing season it's like mid August to mid October and so the only time during the year you could make fresh touch of was those two months he couldn't make a year's worth of ketchup like by this time people were buying millions of bottles of tents have been America alone a year I see couldn't make all that in two months CIA to preserve the pulp but they took terrible standards and practices to preserving so when you opened up that tub of pulp you know come till I had been in to make some to make some some new ketchup it was totally spoil written with bacteria is very dangerous stuff to begin with and that was the basis that they used to start with yet so it was really bad stuff and when Hines created this preservative free version of catch up it was a huge huge breakthrough and way back in eighteen nine he even created the iconic tag and all ketchup bottle yeah that you cannot buy in stores anymore as far as I know that you can still get in restaurants you can take them from restaurants this leave an extra good to take a break here and we'll get back and talk about this foul condiments right after this in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> news <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the the the alright so today catch up is basically made of the salt or onion powder or some spice some kind of sweetener either a lot of sugar are lot of corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup yeah he's I think fruit as concerts the standard and I think it was Hunt's that first came out with a brand that didn't have high fruit as corn syrup made it out it all up and down the Avenue in Hines as far away since I don't do ketchup made the bad mistake of buying the wrong ketchup one time for him we were kind of due to I think it was Hans and you know she is a known and it's like don't bring any hunts and God forbid any Del Monte the church itself sold yeah it's Hines Hines Hines yeah in my house and it is far away the leader I think they have what like sixty or so percent of the market share that's in the US they are about thirty percent of the global market so like not bad Hinds is synonymous literally with cats around the world that's currently no science to write on them as a sponsor the ocean than we would have been able to do a show the ketchup were given the values we do we really do Chuck and adolescence to you on your menu as well so much more standardized depending <Music/Noise> it's either incredibly toxic or actually has some health benefits can be both right I said I think I already said that there is a period were tomatoes were seen as medicine back in the day yet to make the bills yeah they had some made of pills and actually they had tons of pills to the doctor in <Music/Noise> who stole the ideas of another doctor in Michigan and went to a guy who is selling patent medicine and said Hey man tomatoes are super healthy and so by extension should be super healthy and I believe that they do things like um treat indigestion removing bile from the body gets diarrhea touch of jaundice tests of pills write about racism or headaches well so this is where it starts to get a little wacky right they started selling Doctor Mills compound extract of tomatoes and they were successful this is back in eighteen thirty five and they're successful in a much imitators came on the market and um all of a sudden it was not so so great any longer well now it's a lot of them didn't even have tomatoes in them they were fraudulent catch up hills or <Music/Noise> acting as laxatives and so that cause the Great tomato market crash of eighteen forty but today were much smarter than cats of pills we take tomato pills also known as lycopene supplements yet because like subpoenas that's the good stuff that you're looking for that has been shown to help cancer patients specifically the one that they've actually proven as prostate cancer right so they have improved balance shown there's been a mostly positive studies but even still the jury's still out <Music/Noise> okay bye yes prostate cancer is the one that they were roundly point and say like cooking really helps that this Ellie some studies have shown that they like of teen somehow disrupts communication between cancer cells and um it it retards the growth of blood vessels to the cancer cells so they don't think they can grow as well apparently the body produces like AP naturally but also readily absorbs and uses it to one of the great sources of like a peanut is tomatoes lycopene gives tomatoes <Music/Noise> things to brag color but the amazing thing about is if you eat a raw tomato right now you're not going to absorb as much like a teen as if you ate some ketchup right now yes Gary cooked yeah it releases the like Peter makes it more readily available the human body we should say Yeah but they also say even if it does help it's like in our little ketchup on a hamburger is not nearly enough to really do a lot of good no it's something like gum to two point five milligrams of lycopene in a tablespoon of ketchup he say well just eat a bunch to catch a problem is if you eat say like a half a cup about seven tablespoons of ketchup but you just have to be a weirdo <Music/Noise> to do that right you're getting about three quarters of your daily sodium intake and fortunes of added sugar as well be a breeze just better off like eating some tomato sauce since then yet but the point is if like a scene helps humans which the jury's still out but it looks like it's possible think of actually can help humans by giving a little extra ly competing interests this is a very tentative in your new tomato sauce yes and <Music/Noise> these things can add up over time or so ketchup was was selling well in America post Civil War he gets a maid ago and now everyone loves it but there was a problem early on with ketchup that took a long long time to fully solve many of the chair still sort of working on it is the catch of anyone who grew up in the seventies and eighties and loved catch up at a diner would have a hard time getting the ketchup out of that glass bottle and they were there all kinds of tricks I remember <Music/Noise> was that if you tapped on the fifty seven and on the label that would come out better it's true that he had the the jackass who would just smash the bottom of it until catch up would shoot out all across the table that works but not well or the more sheepish person of the diner might stick a butter knife in there I had to cook and coax it out and the <Music/Noise> this is happening is because catch up and this is a little dinner party facto it is a non knew Tony in fluid so if you ever change <Music/Noise> or or even pour water out of the cup you will notice at all pours out at the same rate it has a single viscosity it's a new Tony in fluid Nunes I mean I was a great catch up it can start to come out very slowly and then all of sudden it starts picking up steam coming out <Music/Noise> that's we know you really can that's has different external forces acting upon it to either increase or decrease that viscosity right so it has multiple viscosity which makes it an I knew Tony and flew right up and when you when you put force on it specifically sheer force it changes the viscosity it actually decreases the viscosity because of which increases the flow rate which means it comes out of the bottle faster and one <Music/Noise> that you can introduce sheer force as a G A R is to tap on the bottle yes that can cus of force looses or change the viscosity in the case of flows more quickly so it actually is true there was something to that and yeah that tapping on the embossed fifty seven the the one that was like embossed on the bottle yeah that's that's the perfect spot to tap because if you hit it with the heel of your home under <Music/Noise> the bottle if you didn't know it only if you write you do that lightly all you're doing is is reducing the viscosity of the catch of right and the rear yet the stuffed or the neck of the bottle are trying to get out the remains highly viscous right if you tapped or the neck of the bottle you're going to reduce the viscosity of the catch of its up there in front and it'll start to slide out if you hit that thing on the bottom hard enough that you change the viscosity of all the kids have inside yes going to come shooting out and you know it's like an idiot all your friends are gonna laugh for you you'll die alone that's right so they had a problem with this and they thought in nineteen sixty eight what about ketchup packets this kind of solves a problem you can squeeze it out and they said Yeah that's going to need that might do well for restaurants but no one's going to have the zip lock bag full of ketchup packets in the fridge unless you're my mom and there from like eight different fast food restaurants or goblets are from the others are still around but it finally took till nineteen eighty three come up with a plastic squeeze bottle which still didn't fully work because as this our own article points out they made funny farting noises which I guess is unseemly at the dinner table sugar and then what the industry insiders call serum yet thin watery kind of gross stuff that nobody wants on their their hamburger or hotdog ketchup juice yet toward the end serum comes out and nobody wants that so the squeeze bottles were the ultimate solve it says it's basically just separated water separated from the catch of solids yet and there's Chuck did you know that cooking together build strong family bonds and in fact research shows that blue apron families cook nearly three times more often than <Music/Noise> apron families yes I did know that because we're a blue apron family blue aprons mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone they do this by seven partnerships with over one hundred and fifty local farms fisheries and ranchers across the US yeah and they do it by making it easy

guarantee promises that every ingredient in your delivery arrives ready to cook make a right and we're talking some delicious stuff Chuck Wright oh yes my friend the <Music/Noise> some creamy shrimp rolls with quick pickles and sweet potato which is yeah and don't forget about say some seared Chicken in creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers can be cooking like him Oh man this is delicious and affordable lesson ten dollars per person per meal and it gets even better right now you can get your first three meals for free with free shipping right there to your doorstep by going to Blue apron dot com slash stuff you love how good it feels and tastes of creating incredible home cooked meals of blew it in so don't wait it's blue apron dot com slash stuff blue apron a better way to cook there are actual academic papers on this conundrum this problem with serum separation catch up though I'm sure people trying to figure out how to get away get around it they think they've hybrid eyes to new kind of tomato that allows for less erm separation once processed and attentive even took a need to shake it up I'm a novice but yet you do take it up and it typically works but when I think two thousand to Hines and Hines and apparently Hans was working on a first time scout wind of it and started their own project but almost simultaneously Hines"

endorsement only has her little secrets to for me the me Jesus who sing the song of the details on some TV show mm peanut this I've never heard the song and she said it's a song I know the song I don't <Music/Noise> to some kind of bubblegum pop the thing around in the sky not her but never you never know you know Yeah I met her boyfriend Todd left side than the Vogue he's a jerk he's got frosted tips and he's got a severe arm re so its owner in June we're going to do standardized patients and it's funny the thought occurred to me to go through this entire episode without mentioning Seinfeld all just make people really angry man we've gotten some emails though but that sky like you can't not mention the very famous Seinfeld episode where Kramer and the other guy making oh yeah forgot to make use one to his name as his friend who's a little person yeah they they were I think we got him into it and there they were another called standardized patients I doubt if they said that on the episode right IRA what they call them The surely call them something well they have a few names simulated patient standardized patients care actors weathered those are some of those are different they're generally under the umbrella of say like a serialized or stand simulated patient yeah but they're slowly those little nuances there that make the whole thing revolting the fascinating programs patients and that with the first guy call the yam and if that's not like a brain doctors name for it and <Music/Noise> are there to that eye doctor name Howard Barrow worked out a USC Trojans and use teaching back in the early sixties late fifties I believe and apparently at the time talk they would just eat everything and say OK you've graduated your done by practise medicine good luck with a live human exactly you've never encountered one the entire training but your doctor now so we we wash our hands is the right and so this guy was teaching neurology and realize like I think he had a friend who had come to his sister like observing his graduates in a clinical setting but like after they graduated and were practising doctors and were like whoa whoa you guys are doing this all wrong yeah who taught you this in like you did and he's like I owe it to do something different so that doctor figured out that he could sit down and go through basically observe a doctor doing an entire page in history and <Music/Noise> yet but he's frantically two to three hours in the elite is gonna be a better way to do this shower of arrows was it was his idea and his ID alone right from what I understand this I came across another doctor a woman pediatrician woman named Paulus Stillman who came up with this idea also seemingly independently in the early seventies and into some big time in a nice I think she Amber are kind of like the earliest practitioners of this thing well wasn't a big hit at first like people kind of made fun of them are known this one article you found they were newspaper articles one in L A Herald Examiner headline that said Hollywood invades USC Medical School and the San Francisco chronicle of all places they said scantily clad models were making life a little more interesting for the USC medical students which is really mean I guess it's a sign of the times but really kind of a crappy way to how they made it sound like it was some titillating sexual thing right because you know they have these people that are really doing what you know what I learned was a super valuable service oh yeah for sure I think they're just trying to sex it up for the paper and I mean of course their <Music/Noise> because they were like zodiac killer coming soon What's that stay tuned but he wasn't around us there to do something so they're just trying to take something that was actually a valuable service in pretty straightforward and again sex it up a little bit but actually a kid kept it from catching on for awhile it Lisa first it wasn't until a I think the mid eighties Barrow was able to get it to surge to become adopted throughout the The medical universe the United States only and you know what we've done that thing again Yana where we haven't said what is yet I hear you had to seen Seinfeld and know how to read between the lines of our conversation yes so a simulated patient or standardized patient is sometimes an actor sometimes they have no acting experience sometimes it will get to do these people are but they're generally people looking to make a buck who are fit the profile and of being a fake patient to a medical student so they can get a real practical human to human experience and medical school exactly because there's a big difference between book learning and real life and if you're a doctor a huge huge part of your your job especially non surgical doctor and is conversing with ease and a human being patient and in an on the one hand treating them as a human being as set of symptoms that the big one but then also getting out of them what's wrong with them so you can diagnose them yet as I thought this was all sort of just about bedside manner unlike being you now because it's big for the job you know you want a doctor if you've ever had a doctor that had a poor bedside manner you know what I'm talking about um if you haven't then you might take it for granted that everyone's like that but that's not the case but the second part of that and we think about the director of the standardized patient program at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Valerie former who they interviewed her for this or she was just pulled some quotes but I never thought about it she said communication is at the root of proper diagnosis patient safety and patient satisfaction and mis communication can lead to medical error so they have the big part of the job is drawing out of the patient what the heck is wrong with them because they can examine till the cows come home but they need words right so yeah patient who comes into the doctor's office of the E R is going to be like I have an abscess on my right kidney disease untreated or awesome gonna die of sepsis in the next twelve hours yeah my my my side hurts that you get to have to ask more questions and no questions asked yeah it's diagnose is learning how to diagnose from talking to people and drawing impossible but the bedside manner that's not to be overlooked like that's a big part of it because if people start to think every doctor I've ever interacted with treated me like I was just a bag of organs and bones which we aren't sure thinking to just to let <Music/Noise> that we all have to pretend it's a grand manner exactly but ill keep you from going to the doctor and if you stop going to the doctor than health problems can can start to accumulate and it all the doctors fault for being a sociopathic jerk but you also you know in that dumb it when we're talking about doctors being too empathetic doing OK they had wanted Doctor fell to pieces no you need to learn to walk that fine line between being too clinical in too much of an M path to where the patient feels at ease and taking care of but you feel confident and they're not like breaking down and crying because they have to tell you that you may be dying let's say Yeah but that lady from the University of Pittsburgh whose interviewed in this article points out that there was she remembered at least one medical student who did break down because of an interaction with the simulated patient or standardized patient and that's the point of the city lies or simulator sanitation is so you can go ahead drink down like them get out um in in basically a classroom setting so that when you encounter this in the real world you've already gone through that yeah and down will get into the nuts and bolts of it and of that but um if you're wondering if you want to go do this if you have to like get a prostate exam um you don't have to but if you're if you're open to that to your intuition you can sign up for more intense I am imagine those ones up a little bit better but you can go and volunteer for prostate exam or or or breast exam or anything that involves something a little more invasive yeah but you're not going to get cut or you're not going to get a needle or anything like that they're not in a practice that kind of stuff when I was reading the FAQ on the University of Pittsburgh site about their simulated patients and their point of the reasons simulated cases will not be given drugs yeah than I can inject you with like a cocktail of anti psychotic hse simulation day this may be a good way to score right but it's on you is the simulated patient to him to act as if you're in going through a psychotic break right yeah potentially so that the doctor can learn how to deal with think I'm probably one of the more dramatic examples a lot of them are a lot more pedestrian but that is definitely in the mix as well well even <Music/Noise> will see it you sort of um it's not scripted you do have to be an improvise or of sorts but you're supposed to stick to kind of I don't think are so many just curve balls that you think of in the moment right eye which is what I would want to do which is probably I would not be so Kramer and yet he's made into like a real acting a great night and they say the actors can be good this but it's not acting like they point out that there is no searching for moments of drama Ryan I there to entertain or laying claim to <Music/Noise> so yeah we could be helpful to learn SEO would detect anything or method acting in this one probably method acting so the useful learns some nuts and bolts of of ads is practicing her hse that type of acting but United can connect to your big break or something doing this that's not the point now I think I would join far lighter something something very subtle yer yer trademark yes that would be in the lounge after they'll be like to get the kind that think he was farting is that on purpose or via standardized patient car in St Charles Bryant asked about my trademark words on command I was dumb so we should take a break in sewing it together the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The The <Music/Noise> K everybody Stuff You Should Know comes to you from our friends the rocket mortgage by Quicken loans the There was a rocket taking off that's right and you know my friend when it comes time to buy a house or to get a loan it's it's kind of intimidating to be honest right and chances are in your work or maybe your hobbies your life you have confidence like maybe more confidence when it comes to getting a loan yeah well that's the rocket mortgages here for they give you that same level of confidence when it comes to buying a home or refinancing your existing home because with rock a mortgage you can apply simply and understand fully seeking mortgage confidently Yes it's called One Plus One equals home loan to get started go to Iraq and more in stock com slash stuff they will set you up that's right in there equal Housing lender license in all fifty states in M L S consumer access or Number three zero three zero just go to rocket mortgage dot com slash stuff and take the stress of home the go <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> it the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> Turk listed on the nuts and bolts of nitty gritty little bear I so I said earlier all of this kind of falls under the umbrella of the standardize or a simulated patient and then underneath that umbrella which was kind of <Music/Noise> Burleson is the standardized patient is largely over talking about anything synonymous with the standardized patient and is the program pays their first come first term than George Barrow used for a right and the reason is called standardized programs because he said there isn't a script like you know memorize a script to the doctor says this and you say that you do have a gay you are given a specific set of criteria and it can be really details as well and you're expected to stick to that role that character you take on a character in your character's sick the character's backstory there's certain things that your character is capable of doing and incapable of doing because of the medical condition because of prior medical history and then you go in there and you remain <Music/Noise> this character thing you do it virtually the same way as close to the same is possible for student doctor after Stephen Doctor Christine Doctor Dan usually up to about an in and day in the Eastern doctors supposed to get the same experience from you now and the <Music/Noise> centers because they are being graded on this they're being tested on this it's the closest thing to scientifically reproduce of all that something as objective as bedside manner could be made into that's the point of standardized patients specifically yeah and you the casing of God is either something that just made up like Hey we need somebody that has and maybe a ruptured appendix or whatever that's going to run a run of the meal a meal or another I rather the mill situation but sometimes is an actual case like a real case and that they base it on like someone has actually experienced this it's been recorded and have this case study and they want the doctor to go through this very specific thing and in that case they want to really replicate that right down to like age gender and ethnicity of that actual patient that had that actual case to begin with right exactly I think George Barrow guy who came up with this in the sixties he based his first standardized patient on an actual case that he handled because he knew exactly how I presented exactly what the medical history was in it was something that he thought could be reproduced really easily again and again and this is really interesting essay that was run in the believer but I think it made into a collection in the writer's book buyer writer name was Lee Jamison and the name of the essays The empathy exams since about her experience as a standardized patient oh I really really interesting his house is really investigating the character she's given like think are her main character Scout more than one but her <Music/Noise> as he seems most attached to her brother like a drowned in it after tailgating at a football game and then jumping into a river and drowned years back and she's like still grieving over the loss of her brother and its related to Caesar's but she doesn't even see the character doesn't know that the seizures are basically coming out of grief right so that's it for the doctors assess out that's just one of at least a couple from standardized patients as his play but it's really interesting is great great essay well yen The in this article that you dug up and said that one of the their latte reason someone might want to do this but one of them can certainly be that they had like a family member that died of a certain disease or maybe was mis diagnosed even so they feel like this is like something they can do to help out that kind of research or whatever you know right I ran across so that one of the pitfalls of standardized patients is that the people who do it they can have a hidden agenda sometimes it may be as benign as my brother was misdiagnosed and make sure that doesn't happen anybody else or it can be some I ran across in this comment section on biomedical belong about some doctors said that while he was in training he came across a standardized patient who was sure to list all of the herbal medications that she was taking right then and then she later said that is because you want to make sure that these medical students were made <Music/Noise> of alternative medicine as well yes she is like a specific hidden agenda she wanted to get across to these med students without going to the trouble of going to med school or self and becoming a doctor teacher was kind of came in under the radar basically an apparently they try to route people like that out is not the point of the whole thing but kind of funny how they slip in there so yeah you know you're in character unless you're doing and we'll talk about this later but that one thing that you found and sent me and says that seem like a little bit of a different process where they might have a really specific goal in mind where you'd kind of do most likely acting back and forth with the student doctor but generally they're trying to diagnose use of you walk in the room and you're in character so if you've got kidney pain or bad back or a lamp or whatever then you don't walk in say alright let's get started and then go Oh like they try to make Israel's possibly walk in there in character with no holding your side or whatever <Music/Noise> as you know you know run your face a very hand of your face smiling and frowning he didn't or did any of their lives seem that if the stand as prisons really good we basically indistinguishable from some of the reasons that the doctor will eventually run into and their clinical practice right yeah it's it's uh fans you have to mean if you're not an actor you might be have a talent you to know you had if you're good at this because you have to memorize and internalize and study all this stuff because you have to be just as real as someone who is experiencing something and like that's that's the best like you would be the best actor if you literally become that person that you're playing and that's kind of what you have to do for this right in saying these people if they aren't actors they might want to look into it sure they're good at it yeah so this talk about then so acting is not a being an actor is not a prerequisite for this I know but you could be an actor Viggo and you can be an actor become very quickly frustrated by the whole thing because it's not a thing necessarily it's very specific type of acting right yeah it's literally medical acting but just that's not enough you need to apparently be ceaselessly of the endlessly up being the <Music/Noise> because you're going through this thing say up to ten times <Music/Noise> and these things last from what I saw about forty five minutes to doing this for forty five minutes to make you wait a half an hour to an hour in the in the waiting room before initiating really filling out forms yet has got to get angry before you go in there some guys like often along up next eons ago no contagious it has been crazy not contagious like you don't know you have no idea whether your content right so you have to do this maybe ten times in a row about forty five minutes per from what I saw in that ten point needs to be his greatest performances the first one because there's a tutor for medical students are standard for medical students seeing you in it's twenty C get your best because as far as they're concerned this is their training they are now looking in your days become one of Hanna's this is my cousin I'm being my big test of my big training yes you need to give it one year here are all in MSN to have to have a lot of energy a lot of spunk a lot of positivity and then you also have to be very comfortable dealing with medical professionals which is not necessarily always the easiest plants to deal with what I understand but now I mean if you have a phobia of doctors and this is not good for you sure and I think if you are easily crossed by pushy arrogant people in my not be the best gig for you either I said why not just in the tear again sometime I mean we all saw malice of the asana yeah you do now I've always liked to have a God complex of a God complex I am God as those eligible would like to eat we did and none ever did see that actually I remember the movie though yet as good eighties movie ladies moving yes you can just be like a wilting flower <Music/Noise> and it's all matter pushy or whatever and you also have to be the type who could conceivably take charge think and take control if if a med student is doing that in some kind of maybe dye them back a little bit toward where they should be are the very least being willing to give them feedback to their face is royally screw this whole thing up because there are over aggressive or because they were under assertive who knows you I think you run into all that stuff in you has to be prepared to do this so that brings up another point to us ever really good memory oh yeah because depending <Music/Noise> a lot of the simulated patients will also be required to give feedback yes some of my get the impression I have something to do with like the scoring grading process is well early so you have to be in character yes every character's history symptoms everything memorized if the stay in character you have to respond to the doctors questioning and then you have to be paying attention to all the stuff the doctor should be asking all the stuff the doctors failing to ask and the doctors just behavior in general so you can give accurate feedback afterward and then YES to do it sometimes in a run today yes this serves a very specific need them the obvious the well there's a few things and they're all somewhat obvious but it bears going over some experience of medical students you don't want them practicing on a real sick person because if they mess up that's not good right those having almost like a live eye recess Annie on your hands is good to live her sister and my mom is to bring the stones used to teach CPR would you do with them I tried to teach and then I'm going to kiss I knew something weird going on I tend to learn CPR her that I think I've learned in life or five times in my life is key for getting it so one thing I do remember is you want to do it to the press the icicle read in the region chest compressions to the beat of staying alive my Aunt Lee and then apparently you don't give a breathing aid don't consider nose and breathe <Music/Noise> for a couple reasons one you are exhaling carbon dioxide directly into their lungs that stupid and two they don't really have a way to expel it so now the pantry for my understandings as recommend chest compressions until paramedics arrive as the latest accurate don't know the story published this we should say to that when a train medical professionals know when I'm in training medical actors and <Music/Noise> now taking life saving advice from a guy who learned to kiss from a lifeless synthetic was a lifeless and I was I I she went Oh yeah it's a little curly wigs phone ahead to the first thing is an experience you don't want to a medical student to be messing up on real people number two is availability they have to teach have to run the gamut of America"

<Music/Noise> does the couple are deep thinkers hanging out on the Sto yeah this specifically what is that this so did you practice the word whose pronunciation and all tried to pronounce a lot of this but you know ancient Greek as you know the phrase It's All Greek To Me comes from not being open up these things quite literal the Stowe of poise Keely I think that's probably pretty close man so can I start this with a couple of quick thoughts first of all I took a three to four different philosophy courses before we recorded like what kind of philosophy do you subscribe to quiz yes you know the ones that are super accurate his right as they can figure that out in eight of fifteen questions sure and then you can move on to find out what Muppet your eye so here's here's my results here for the person I was epicurean ok the second one existentialism right third one atheist existentialist in the fourth need to slash stoic neat it was a huge critic of Stow is among surprise they put this together well that's that is Chuck though you know in San years <Music/Noise> contradiction in terms of yearning <Music/Noise> the reason I took these because when I was doing the research on Sosa them um I found Me From myself a lot of times going yet totally in a lot of things going now it's really not me same here same here and I think I'm the even the stoic is from back in a day you realize that there are very few very very few actual what they called sages walking around stoic sages who really fulfilled every aspect of this to a T and I think that I think one of the reasons why I still was is and today is is making a comeback and is so appealing is because those two reasons one more than some kind of a <Music/Noise> gazing type philosophy we are trying to figure out the nature of existence or something like that it's more a blueprint for existing day to day in a in a useful happy way and then secondly it's at it you can kind of pick and choose some is like a bus a You can pick and choose what aspects of it you want to adopt or use and no Creek ghost is going to come along in here you in the face with a Trident punch yeah I think that's I mean first of all the Age <Music/Noise> fascinates me to no end to come in second I wanted to cover some of the the great philosophies of all time this is a good start well it is but it's just kind of daunting because people spin like that through life's work now and did for us to try and summarize any of them in thirty to forty five minutes is kind of like you know I don't know what philosophy you would liken that to foolish ism done done to them <Music/Noise> know this if this all goes well maybe we'll take a design that we can tackle some other ones but you're absolutely right given the even just like say The Internet encyclopedia of Philosophy which is meant its sharp in its detailed and exhaustive but it's also clearly meant for lay people interest in philosophy right it's just just this just owe us ism is so involved it's not possible for us to really capture all of it even given an overview you know um they're giving is just hitting the highlights of camp possibly had all the highlights is too much to it and that's just us ism I still say it's worth talking about those because it's so interesting so if I get up in the middle going to pull me back keep going well I like the Urban Dictionary definition yet stoic as someone who does not give a shit about the stupid things in this world that most people care so much about dogs do have emotions but only for the things in this world that really matter they're the most real people alive and then their little example is a group of kids sitting by the porch stoic walks by when Qin says something very mean hey your blanking blank a new blank blank the stoic says Good for you and keeps coming right the party really like to hear that my man I am so that person on so many levels but then sometimes I'm totally not and I think what the differences are what matters is depends on if they say something that matters to you or if something does matter to you like I get really riled up about some stuff that I was making us though that doesn't try letting anyone else up but I also some things that really make other people irate dislike man can change it is what it is now only can get upset about the things I can change yeah if you could apply that to everything you'd be pretty pretty high up there in the stoic pantheon to be a stoic face or general pretty much five five finger points guy are a wee bit <Music/Noise> I mean that was a pretty good definition actually even those from the Urban Dictionary but we say we picked Owen up from a day on article I still misses him as one of the best Mind hacks ever devised a good one by Larry Wallace yeah did a good job giving an overview the whole thing I think Larry Wallace is one of the great modern style assists maybe there's plenty of <Music/Noise> these days <Music/Noise> will go back in time and study the beginnings of sources and because we're talking about like it the word stoic today and it means it was taken from this but it's kind of someone like sort of a grim face stoic doesn't say much mom and that's not what's tosses them and they say an article several times with a capital S really is all about right yeah these things people typically I should say these days up to about three years ago people thought of stoic says somebody who can watch their dog to have buy a car and you know their reaction was to raise their chin a little higher up in the <Music/Noise> like just grin and bear it as Larry put it on a first name basis with Lee Wallace declare that it's a philosophy of grim endurance tolerating <Music/Noise> than transcending life saggy knees and adversities just kind of trudging through um it just taking hit after hit from life as the deals deals them to you right now yeah I was the idea still has them you can kind of like it's not like this is radically unlike actual Stowe is is um but it's an outsiders interpretation of what the stomachs are actually doing with actually going on the purpose of the whole thing outsiders view that doesn't really fully understand it became the popular view until recently until it started to kind of gain some traction lately yeah you know throughout the year so so season has informed some religions these days are a lot of atheists are so ex but I like the article says it is above all it teaches the value of emotional control in living one's life fully yeah so here's the basis of it the basis of it is if you can um t catch yourself from emotional responses to things and something that comes along <Music/Noise> good or bad is not going to get your goat right socialism is all about protecting your goat and not letting anything get it with the way that they do that is by saying der very few things that I can control in life and everything that I can control I'm not going to get riled up over in a lose my job oh well happens it doesn't mean I'm any less of a person idea to go on get another job dog gets hit by a car well that's really awful because I really like the dog but all this go get another dog or maybe I'll just learn to live without the dog maybe I was becoming too attached to the dog things like that that Stowe says of the whole point of it is it's not just to get your goat it protects your go from being Don it's about living a moral life where you're very good human being and the idea is that the only <Music/Noise> is through things like rationalism and investigating the universe and being understanding of knowledge and then pursuing ethics specific ethics and they they they figure out the best way to do that is this passionately yeah I think my bumper sticker would say onboard colon part time stasis full time dreamer that is specific the air a bumper sticker a seven lot of bumper stickers in high school and now I loathe them so much really what did you have like <Music/Noise> Volkswagen beetle in that was my theme I actually bought brand new in nineteen sixty eight was passed down to Kid to Kid and an heirloom that was it was very cool I thought it time well it is cool I love the Beatles but I just went through in those phases where I was like in now here's <Music/Noise> saying hear some about Mother Nature and this Bob Marley had this to say and oh yeah those and now I see those cars with all the things and dislike shut up nobody cares I could maybe <Music/Noise> do yeah for sure I mean a three eleven sticker This is pri three Love Actually ok so did your mom come be like what you do the family <Music/Noise> no stickers now it's funny the car head <Music/Noise> the rear floor board was missing on one side my dad had a car like that a Malibu seafood like see the street there now they look I mean <Music/Noise> a piece of work now will effect him like that was extraordinarily <Music/Noise> irresponsible be driving around with kids in the backseat with this street visible to lower the dose is like watching kids easy does it all right so if you want to go back and talk about history a little bit not only key being around our aid was given the way back machine and OK we need to really juice it up because we're going way back get some kerosene get some banana peels and guys some airplane glue but that's just for a strike is a long ride to the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> ancient Greece's were headed to the time of the great philosophers and we said earlier sit here on the Stow A That was a joke but it was and you've said so you can to try again this stone of poi Keely yes or painted porches what it means and that was a public space in Athens Greece is a portico yeah we're people hang out and talk into the fat in that's what I love about this time was people just alive with ideas these philosophical ideas of trying to figure it all out of it don't you think like everyone so he's like oh everybody shut up I just live the good in something useful yeah places styled Hocking yeah I I agree with the overall is was a pretty thrilling time to take philosophy in college at all no no I didn't um I really did not think it took a single philosophy class and I think about and even a survey of the one in a general classic as is the one on one and I actually made an A which didn't make a ton of A's in college and I remember the time of the same thing about half the class was like so fascinating and that of the other half is this like Man what a waste of time to do something useful like to volunteer for a charity to make something out of wood I write so back to the Stow were on this painted porch this portico as our people are everywhere <Music/Noise> their mouths but what they think is important and then this dude wanders up Z now of City of you who'd recently been shipwrecked and the others he knows not to confuse I know this confusing there <Music/Noise> Z know they can be an all in all of history their words he knows of other things but this is the most idiom you're right he was shipwrecked and he was wandering <Music/Noise> after trip from Cyprus to say where in Athens by a Georgia know although we did our fair share of sitting around porches talking nonsense their porch porch yet agree or Z know a little bit of <Music/Noise> insight from the sex and then eventually said You know I like my kind of forming my own thoughts here and I think everyone else is doing it I have my own philosophy yeah its called Stow is named after later I don't think he called it the onus or he'd probably call is no ism camera sucks cos i was in after the porch but this is I mean like this Towson very quickly became one of the Big of philosophies at the time oh yeah and it rivaled some of the philosophies that grew out of like Socratic philosophy and like you said cynicism the cynics teacher and actually if you look at Stowe aces them it's kind of a compromise between Socrates or so creases bill and ten call them a philosophy which was that to lead a good life and this is the point of all of the philosophies at this time during this age of reason was achieving what was called Yu <Music/Noise> A New Time <Music/Noise> A is a life worth living is thriving and flourishing it's being happy like real happiness right that was a pursuit of all of these different ideas are floating around the time was how to achieve that Socrates had the idea that you achieve that through like twelve Cardinal virtues and some of them were things you cultivate in yourself like courage a sense of justice that kind of stuff than their other ones too had like everything to do with luck like being good looking as one of them hey yes if you're good look if you're ugly sorry buddy you could never achieve you time money and right on the other end of the spectrum are the cynics and the cynics believe that earthly trappings like wealth and fame and glory anything like that was the path to ruin and that the true path to you die ammonia was living simply living in poverty and so you know comes along and hears all these and it is formulating <Music/Noise> ideas he's like Socrates makes some sense over here and so to the cynics a little bit but I'm putting together and that's where still has them came from it was a compromise between the two where you live a life of pursuing <Music/Noise> through these virtues for virtues I think there's justice courage wisdom and temperance right so you're practicing those four virtues so that that's kind of a nod to Socrates um and you don't have to live in poverty you can be wealthy because this shows is a MS anything it's why wealthy people who got into philosophy that weren't quite sure how to feel about being well to say the kind of go to the point that like having money is not a bad thing right right and so was really what they came up with was um sure you can be wealthy and that's okay you can prefer to be wealthy but you just can't be attached to it you can desire to be wealthy because you can control the wealthy and if you pursue being wealthy you're pursuing something beyond your control so if you happen to be wealthy that's great you can be happy with it but also be prepared to <Music/Noise> given time and that's a big part of Stow is is um yeah I think it's so funny to think about like thousands of years ago in ancient Greece like they spent so much time thinking about living this all the schools of thought of living this life so like putting so much thought into living life to its fullest in all the different ways that they defined it eventually like over the years like his recently is like the generation <Music/Noise> of our parents and grandparents United States like the philosophy of life was like you just go to work and work hard till you die and that's the only thing that matters exactly like all that stuff is garbage yeah well I think that's one of the reasons why stores is a MS is becoming appealing again is this idea like work seems to be kind of going through weird transformation doesn't think it's not like that anymore like that I think is still around for sure but for many people you know work from home like almost entirely it alot alot and it's fairly new so I wonder if like this changing work dynamic is leading to this resurgence in Stow was is and that you can find happiness through other stuff I mean when you think this is all like super worthwhile and part of me thinks and it sort of indulgent to set an end of it like you said naval Jay Z and Mike just start practicing good things instead of sit around thinking about the best way to live life well talk about criticisms <Music/Noise> but I think a big one though Chuck was the idea that it's self indulgent because it demands introspection almost every moment of every day yeah you and take a break and get back to get my head together worst airplane glue it's <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> uh <Music/Noise> uh <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the you know my friend I don't shave any longer because my face is a big mess of hair back when I did love me some Dollar shave Club yeah minutes because

kind of thing no it's pretty tough to be smart and Huff model airplane glue you're pretty much making a choice between that being so much so that you early on the euro goes where life is one of the airplane glue it's the one thing Nancy Reagan <Music/Noise> about the right so <Music/Noise> get things going and peace of mind that comes with living a life of virtue in accordance with reason and nature and then other dude got on boards and of course the boards got on board <Music/Noise> were all due to back then because everything is from the man's perspective one point that out yet because this change so dramatically since then but some of the other early stasis client these Kato Kato of a younger elder younger right to the kale and love which Cato I think it's the younger will find out from two people who email <Music/Noise> Seneca and then a very important so is this Well pronounce it epic epic to protect this epic at us like a vaccine shot it does E P I C T E A T u s c going <Music/Noise> be the canyon with epic tedious or epic status I think epic fetuses were we to go with one another see in there wanted to be a protect this but it's not no it's not a fictitious right so don't forget Marcus or alias man oh well sure I mean he comes later <Music/Noise> was he was the the ruler of the infant was my problem the day came every minute you may use the philosopher king and that was when the season was kind of the most popular thing going yeah yeah apparently they moved from Athens to Rome which don't realize this I always had the idea that <Music/Noise> venerated <Music/Noise> Hellenistic Greece hundreds of years after basically the Greek civilization have had to kind of gone into a bit of it while later had gone out of its heyday right now there's total cross pollination feature including some of these early stoic who travels from Athens to Rome am basically with with that move transferred the seed of philosophy from Athens to Rome from Greek to run to come to Rome from Greece around I din realise that there're they were actually like cross pollinated <Music/Noise> at the time did you know that I think I recall that from deep in my college memory banks nice so protect the status man whom he <Music/Noise> the stoic movement he was former slave him which kind of makes sense in for in terms of Sosa them he almost almost single handedly gives credence to those of them because so many other Stokes were extraordinarily <Music/Noise> powerful manager that it's like it's pretty easy for you to go through life saying you know it's just just take what life gives you life is giving you nothing but gold bullion all the time right this guy <Music/Noise> a slave crippled in the knee for life and in became a stoic one of the great stoic thinkers and just threw his life proved that still has them can work yet he wrote a handbook of the time was called in in Caribbean and he rode the entire eighty in of epic tennis anchor idiom <Music/Noise> handbook it means ready at hand so it was very famous hymn book any attributed I mean the first line of it was some things are in our control and others not and that's kind of sums it all up like he could've said the end but he decided to dive a little deeper I agree with you I think our brand of Stow is them has about the same contours that right there that's all that's everything you <Music/Noise> there is some things you can control most things you can control their ego get too high to low I don't get too mad about something ultimately I think that's what it boils down to I don't really find much of a problem when people are overjoyed I don't think that's an issue and technically with stoic ism that is that the problem you should not become overjoyed experiencing joy is fine but just being like overcome with happiness or joy <Music/Noise> grief or whatever it is you're you're you're violating <Music/Noise> of those four Cardinal virtues temperance is just being tempered an even keel right so but I think if you're saying don't get upset about something is out of your stroll don't blame others don't try to control other people just know that whatever comes you can handle it they go so you need to know for me yeah and you know I mean how many times have you heard me say it is what it is which is annoying thing to hear and say but it's pretty stoic well it is but it's also in my case like it is what it is until it isn't it just matters if I've been personally riled up about something you know Yeah but I think again though it's like there's probably some people who listen to who subscribed to at least modern status is in listening to this and I would guess that they would say this because terrorism is basically meant to apply to everyday of your life like no stoic ser really expected to become sages in their lifetimes right that is something you just do every single day is try to not get riled up but of course are some things can come along the route that's just human nature still has them is trying to put a bridle <Music/Noise> human nature yet well this is"

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> am open to the podcast on Josh Clark those of you took pride in tears over there so this is stuff you should know the podcast correct we are not going dark no I think it is a thing for the <Music/Noise> battle for the next action and a battle of the Network Stars nope just net at all for it in net yet which I would guess most people have heard of maybe not by that name necessarily but say if you're John Oliver fan or have been paying attention at all to the FCC rules about net neutrality battle for the net is is kind of at the forefront of all that Kansans are show comes out on a Tuesday which is July love and that is the day that some websites elected to go dark I think they're going dark the next day on the twelfth yeah okay alright Well than this of that but we figured we were actually someone wrote in suggesting this um maybe instead of going dark as you probably can't do that maybe should just do an episode on net neutrality to teach all the peoples about the things right it was a pretty pretty good a suggestion I agree that suggestion yeah I feel bad that we um I can't remember who it was that Rodin but thank you for that whoever <Music/Noise> are because you're the only one who did and they don't do it for the glory now so what are we talking about so called were talking about net neutrality or network neutrality or open Internet so what that is mainly what people mean when they say net neutrality is the idea that the Internet is an open road and it does it have fast lanes slow lanes is providing equal access to anyone who wants to build a website lets say can can throw it up there and have equal access to the big rollers on the Internet with the huge sites you're all the same as far as how people can access you in whether or not they can access you yeah last they can access you exactly right there is this sum is greater explain or inbox about neutrality that we use the resource but they they gave this good example of net neutrality right so they they pointed out that when Facebook was created the cover didn't have to go to Comcast or Verizon or any of the ISP is the Internet service providers the companies that provide the last mile connection between your house in the public Internet yea that's what an ISP is very important to remember that part I didn't have to go to them and say Hey would you carry my website on your network he just built a website plugged into <Music/Noise> uploaded to the Internet was available to any device or computer that was connected to the Internet anywhere in the world right yeah and the fact that he didn't have to go to the mask that to be added <Music/Noise> the fact that he have to go to them to say Hey I need people to be able to download the stuff fast so here's a bunch of extra money from the fact that he didn't do that that's how it has been to this point and that is network neutrality that's the that's the basis of net neutrality is specially from the standpoint of developers and companies that they create sites and applications on the web yeah it's it's a very large spider crawling to me they saw something out a quarter mile month coverage alert because it looks now yeah just expired or no good for you so it's in levels the playing field and all Internet traffic is treated equally right so not <Music/Noise> the playing field for people who are creating you know Facebook or Netflix erm what have you it also levels the playing field for littles the experience for users write in if you're a user hang you are on the Internet through your ISP like you should be getting whatever site you want to go to at the same speed as any other site and your Internet service providers shouldn't be able to decide when we don't really like you getting that site we don't really like you <Music/Noise> we're going to make it so that this this traffic moves so slowly going to give up trying to download it or was going to block it entirely yeah and why maybe because that's a competitor to us in some way we would like to serve you up our products faster so preventing these from being able to do that that's over an open Internet or network neutrality okay yeah that's the basis of that is currently how it stands right now and the <Music/Noise> network neutrality it's it's um I guess about fifteen years old back in a two thousand to a guy named Tim Wu who is a Columbia University law professor notably coin the term network neutrality basically describe a level playing field for everybody involved try it especially at the um internet service provider level and since then it's become this topic of debate like sure did should this be something that we <Music/Noise> adopt is like the basically the rules for the Internet should network neutrality be the basis of how the <Music/Noise> is built and approached is a big deal because we are even though it seems like are far along we are still in the infancy stage of the Internet and the impacts would be long lasting and huge moving forward further from what I understand most people agree that net neutrality is at its base is this an agreeable way to frame the the internet yet so wait to be there is even making two dozen for teens will see we just went through this and we're going through it again now but back in two thousand and fourteen there were a pair of polls that I ran across from two different groups one of those University of Delaware chairman of the other one was but it found that even among conservatives that net neutrality is is highly valued something like eighty to eighty three percent of people who identify as conservative say that ISP should be prevented from slowing or blocking traffic right and that Congress actually do something about it right so people people by and large agree that net neutrality is the way the Innes ago the division that is really kind of come out especially recently is how good can be achieved you achieve it by giving power to the FCC to go police the ISP isn't find them and basically make life hard for them if they don't follow <Music/Noise> or do you remove any teeth that the FCC might have been policing the diocese in his leave it up to competition and depending on where you fall ideologically as far as government regulation goes is probably <Music/Noise> you're going to fall along the spectrum of net neutrality yeah and it's it's not the black and white thing like you would think um like in user to saying Yeah you know there's got to be no neutrality <Music/Noise> what there's a lot easier like on a man all I care about is streaming my stuff is efficiently and fast as possible and with getting rid of net neutrality would increase the competition and I could get my Netflix movies all summer and faster them all for it right than the other side you've got big corporations that maybe don't feel like you think they might yeah you think you know the surf like this usually when the governments involved it's like a big guy big corporation has little guy kind of thing but now there's a there's a dispute between corporations to like you said where I S P's like Verizon and Comcast are many themes he are lined up against the tech companies like the tech media companies like YouTube and Netflix and formerly tumbler of the other guy's Facebook Google lawyer there are on opposite sides of this this issue which is strange because they need each other they are very incestuous relationships that are very complicated and complex but as far as net neutrality goes they are pretty much divided between dioceses in TEC media companies one side is against the net neutrality rules one side is strongly in favor of them going to talk about complicated like in the future companies corporations merging in an ISP is being a part of the same company or getting into the media content game like things are getting interesting now yeah interesting but also kind of scary because right now back in well back in two thousand and fifteen the FCC struck a huge blow to the highest keys with a set of new rules four hundred page compendium I guess you'd call it of rules that basically said You guys can't mess around anymore I asked keys are not <Music/Noise> to block or throttle or provide fast lanes stuffs given real in the net really is going to be neutral from now on and that was under Obama and some cousin pointed to a different FCC chairman who is a member of the SCC before and he is not in favor of that also do want to talk about the what the two fifty two thousand and fifteen rules are and how it is for the moment well here's what I think we should do is take a break okay I should go back in time when we come back and talk a little bit about the phone companies which will come set stage for what came on today ok ar I will be right back the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The The <Music/Noise> the you know my friend I don't shave any longer because my face is a big mess of hair back when I did love me some Dollar shave Club yeah minutes because Dollar shave Club is the smarter

<Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> promise talk about phone companies because that's exciting stuff it's amazing how much telephone companies have shaped law and policy in this country over the years yeah yeah I guess this with the telephone monopolies bike in the daemon that was so very interesting day you use to have to lease your telephone from the phone company cable him by telephone due least it yet where does one telephone company wasn't his bell yeah basically Ma Bell and they've broken up into smaller bells the Baby bells think what they call them the like from my childhood so I didn't really look that much of that um but we're talking about the FCC here is the governing body and back in the seventies and eighties they were sort of early and on this game with the phone companies in the early days of computer networking and they they came out <Music/Noise> they had a lot of foresight back then said You know what we need to guarantee consumers with the right to use modems on their phone lines yeah because this is like everyone see more games and we all know that that's that's how the future is going right he got to put your phone on a big box yeah receiver on a big box I wanted this so bad oh yeah like you they're so expensive you literally connected your phone right I had no idea what to do with it I just thought like well that's the idea of yours clause but the but treating the trees saying Okay everybody has the right to have a modem in their house and use a phone line use it that's that's that was a a kind of a radical idea and the reason why is because when you're talking about telephone carriers right like back in the day eighteen ti Ma Bell way you are saying is you're a private corporation you've gone and <Music/Noise> telephone wires all throughout the United States you guys built the U S telephone infrastructure and yes we the government the taxpayers give you substantial tax breaks and lots of benefits to doing this and you guys are the <Music/Noise> the money operating these phone lines but we have decided that the phone lines are so important to the public good you guys <Music/Noise> to just be a normal corporation that the government stays laissez faire hands often with you guys are deemed order considered common carriers like the road yeah we're like the people who carry people on roads like goods and people right here like an airline <Music/Noise> like me like a cargo transport ship you like a Greyhound bus with telephone lines right so the government said everyone should be able to have access to telephone lines you can charge people for that X is big you can't mess with their axes were not letting you in the seventies one of the things are the eighties I think one of the things the government said was Hey you know how we're kind of the bosses of you guys even though your private corporations well we're going to boss around right now and say any business that wants to come along in use your phone lines to provide dial up modem service to their customers you have to let them do it and that was all the good it was for the public going <Music/Noise> the dial up Internet industry was able to blossom on Saturday with government protection right the government got in between that blossoming industry that was in competition with the telephone companies and the telephone companies that could have strangled in the cradle that was that was the first big thing that as he did as far as the Internet goes again in nineteen ninety six a very important distinction was drawn with basically Congress drawing of two categories and this you'll see plays out kind of over and over and will continue to in the future two different things telecommunication services and information services so telecom services were talking about the phone lines that what we're talking about here and um as far as the laws concern there are a lot of like you were talking about legal obligations on these services and the FCC has a lot of oversight and regulation over them yeah information services on the other hand they said like Facebook that's an information service YouTube as an information service they were less well basically exempt from most of the FCC regulations so dividing those things into was a very very big deal and during the Clinton years what most people would consider what budget pie which we his trumps them pick to chair the FCC he called the Clinton era basically up to two thousand and fifteen a light touch regulation which is what he is in favor of and will get to email them or a minute um but it's that Clinton era FCC regulations of basically did what you're talking about and said You know what we want DSL that's the newest thing for dial up we want to send faster speeds over the Internet and you all have to play along so they did it again to the phone companies they wanted to remember dial up modems don't want any longer body wants DSL so now you guys have to lay any DSL provider use your phone lines and that let the DSL the beginning of the high speed Internet industry flourish right so there's this pattern of the SCC coming in being like you guys are huge you guys who provide that last mile you common carriers who are the gatekeepers between the public at large and the public Internet you guys standing between them and were saying you can do this you can't do that you can do this you can do that and for a while the highest keys were classified as telecommunications services which meant that they fell under way more oversight and scrutiny like you said than say like YouTube and the reason the government did this was to let the internet start to bloom right yes and I'm not sure why I guess because it was Bush era and <Music/Noise> Bush FCC chair said we shouldn't be classifying Eyes peas as telecommunications companies anymore but we haf to it's the law he went to court and the court said no actually you guys of the FCC if you wanna start classifying Internet service providers as information services which are not as heavily <Music/Noise> you guys go ahead and do that so the Bush era as CCS said OK well we hereby decree the Internet service providers are not the akin to the Bell telephone switchboard operators of your they're much more akin to you too are part of the Internet which if you really think about it doesn't make much sense but that that was said that was a huge sea change in what the government could say or do to ISP they gave them <Music/Noise> freedom to do a lot more stuff after they were classified as information services yeah and then <Music/Noise> in two thousand in the chair this EC at the time Julie is again a cow ski said you know we've got some new regulations on the books I'm going to privatize these from blocking content online we're going to prohibit what we call unreasonable discrimination and there are going to have to be little more transparent about what's going on and this is in the Era broadband now right and then Verizon stepped up and said You know what we don't like the sounds of this this is you guys are stepping way over your congressional power here yeah they said well don't forget you guys classify this as information services you can tell us to do or not do this stuff or telecoms any more suckers yeah pretty much in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Verizon and this is just and twenty four teams are just a few years ago then said those rules have got to go as long as are classified that way then you're going have to play by these rules that change again in two thousand and fourteen when Tom Wheeler came along as the chair the FCC and he kind of flip flop he came out initially and propose some rules that people said no that's like that's way too weak draw write while he was thinking they got leaked and there is a huge backlash in public outcry against it in but I don't think anyone was surprised because Tom Wheeler was a longstanding lobbyist for the cable <Music/Noise> industries right so he was an industry insider who is supposed to be regulating the industry that he was already friends with and where is back on or so nobody's really surprised too and Bessie came out these really weaken the rules and I as peas but there was a huge backlash so yeah it yeah that was the first battle for the net and then Wheeler went whoa I was just kidding here's here's my real document he didn't really say that but he came up with a new document with with bigger sharper teeth and that was what you reference earlier the four hundred page document called the two thousand fifteen Open Internet Order which was a really big deal and that was a surprise because we learned and who is a lobbyist for the these very industries not only reversed course from these toothless and weak lot of rules to much stronger rules they were in step with what the net neutrality advocates are asking for he actually went even further and made even stronger tighter net neutrality rules and then took the time to write something like three hundred pages of rules explaining the logic and the thought behind all this which could pose a problem as will talk about leader for a GE Tai and the trumpet CCS to get past the the it was a huge huge surprise that came out <Music/Noise> victory for net neutrality advocates and for Obama and his administration it became one of the signature acts I guess or watershed moments for the Obama administration because he campaigned as a Net neutrality supporter and then finally one year the last year of his presidency his SCC just drop the mike on net neutrality instead it is is done yeah and within that open Internet order one of the first time he did a couple of big things but the big big thing it did was it said Hey remember way back in nineteen thirty four Communications Act we think we can actually re classify broadband as what we're going to call a title to telecommunications service so remember <Music/Noise> we said they split up in the the two buckets this all changed a couple years ago when they can now classify you know Verizon or Comcast as a telecom service which again means it's a common carrier and much more heavily regulated yes so the SCC was like o <Music/Noise> O we can tell you what to do if you're classified as an information service well you're no longer classified as that you'd classify as a telecommunications service now and we are up your rectum is so interesting that this week we've seen the birth of this industry that lake is being figured out in full view well maybe not always hold you I don't say no yeah like Nolan still it's still being <Music/Noise> now oh yeah it's really interesting so those those the first thing that the two thousand and fifteen Open Internet order to dry it re classified the IIS keys back to telecommunications this rally it took them out of the same league as YouTube and Netflix and all of these these content providers on the web and said the new guys actually handle the nuts and bolts of it you don't handle the actual content so your telecom now than it is second part two which was basically saying We're than the net is now neutral we're instilling net neutrality values onto the Internet as the FCC yeah and will do so in three main <Music/Noise> no blocking can block lawful content like services can block applications as long as it's lawful and legal kind that can block it you can throttle it to me throwing is a weird word it seems counter intuitive thought for Leo think means the speed something up but in this case it means you can slow something down yeah basically I would say breaking her right not rattling yeah laying on top of that probably basically means as ISP you can come in like we're talking early and Zan you know and your competition Netflix to our Comcast services so we want to make sure no one can stream anything very well right so we can slow you down and then the final one was no paid prioritization so no fast lanes yeah the kit you can pay someone to juice up your site write so that you can get an edge over the competition which I mean like if Netflix is doing that Amazon Prime nobody's really said and it's here like Amazon Prime or big kids and they can handle themselves but if you are you know developing the next streaming video app and you don't have the money to to compete against Netflix you're a huge disadvantage and has been pointed out is a potentially stifling did to new technology yeah for sure so um one of the things that the SEC's two thousand and fifteen rules said were the ISP zz have to behave in a quote just in reasonable man I think he said that right now I didn't ok well they do that's part of it"

<Music/Noise> loves you do a good man doing this by myself kind of relaxed okay I'm not feeling feverish if that so you driving in them ye know not to know anymore although I am for a long time like I've never been like a fever person and probably had like a handful maybe how many fevers <Music/Noise> not eaten since I was a kid yeah not a lot of adult fevers right I mean of head like a pop fever and rock'n'roll fever yellow fever I've had the fever for flavor Pringle home <Music/Noise> to wear this is anime that agents are the potato crisps and nuts are good they're mashed together potatoe parts I don't think I want to know how those are made now it's like taking MC nuggets I think the unicorn poop them out have you seen unicorn pizza a little much it's that there's a restaurant in New York I'm not quite sure where <Music/Noise> their unique armpits it's like um no tickets are like a nice pastel colored frosting instead of sauce and some amount of time candy nerds or pop rocks maybe the Lord and some other stuff supposedly taken in good ol' eat anything that has enough frosting on it like frosting but I'm going to like sugary candies really like nerds him pop rocks and stuff that you know I did a brain stuff on some pop rocks now it was interesting yeah yeah your tongue actually warms the pop rocks to the point where they melt in since they have C O two trapped inside <Music/Noise> process this year to Sydney's released in a pop just a little bubble of see it in yeah that's gotta be good for you it's funny my roommate in college not many adults eat candy that people eat chocolate and stuff like that candy bars but hey Candy Candy though <Music/Noise> is just a little strange with and we can each share like what Mentos not mint Mentos like candy meant us like those well I had a roommate that would go to the convenience store next and this is college granted but he still eats the stuff I think OK and he would go with like fifteen dollars and buy you know like giant sweet tarts in the two boys are and like a fun dip and nerds and just all kinds of candy fund in memory like a maid is the same thing and think yeah right like I don't have a foot but I've got my look a main dome and ten UI can you guys out there and podcast plant over stalling because we are big time because we happened upon a topic that no <Music/Noise> what's what yeah I mean we're talking the fever dreams we know Buffy verse to know about dreams yet but apparently <Music/Noise> one's really got into work and figuring out what fever dreams themselves are largely anecdotal yes sir you have to bear with us and believe it will leave it there for now but I guess a good place to start is by talking about both those things separately and starting with fevers you know you've always heard ninety eight point six Fahrenheit is the normal internal body temperature Yemen in the ninety two there was a big study this is really ninety eight point two mm depending on like how old you are what time it is <Music/Noise> doing where you put in your butter in your armpit or in your mouth or in your ear or <Music/Noise> something it can vary a little bit so I think there's a bit of a slight a sliding scale to that number yeah for sure but I think the key is is it can be roughly around <Music/Noise> and even if you <Music/Noise> an average body temperature that's not exactly nineteen point six and say you typically tend toward ninety seven point five run cooler yeah your body temperature still during <Music/Noise> day going to fluctuate plus or minus about a degree Fahrenheit <Music/Noise> way yes oh look a little <Music/Noise> eight point six in the original dude that came up with that was a German physician name our Ryan hold out just fun to lick it good good one when eighteen sixty eight he wrote a book well he did the studies or had this temperature I would stick under the armpits of all these people is like already on clean everyone it's that everyone always says I you know the comedian Rory school know you should check him out okay he does these weird things like ill just do his whole routine with a German accent for no reason whatsoever I like the sound and he did one about stealing old people kidnapping old from South Carolina anything but he's done shows with like a severe southern accent and one just normal accent to a German thing he dislikes the mass of people I guess his career I will check my things is one of my favorites so anyway um eighteen sixty eight he wrote a book called After these experiments called dose of their hearts than to conform are unkind can heighten that is good and it's funny the real translation I think of that is on the temperature in diseases but I think Google translate comes out is the behavior of the intrinsically warm in sick units I I that's the subtitle yeah yeah anyway he's a guy that came up a ninety eight point six and that stood for a long time but that's just so that was just based on his observations his study and yet the kit was an average wasn't like this is what you should be is just the average of all these people right and then one hundred and thirty years later we finally got <Music/Noise> whether that was actually true or not la Mina says ninety two that they said it was ninety eight point two from another study but then everything is still read as ninety eight point six so I know you're talking about though I've heard the last few years that they like the ninety eight point six Chez is kind a kind of made up right so um the point is that your body's going to be roughly somewhere <Music/Noise> or normal body temperature yes and then depending on the time of day it's either going to be a little cooler in her little <Music/Noise> that and our body temperature is regulated by something called the hype without Amos and like I said depending on time a day your body temp is going to fluctuate and that's tied to sleep apparently your body temperature is rising usually <Music/Noise> afternoon is about where it peaks during the day that's associated with wakefulness alertness not necessarily just having a high body temperature but in incline <Music/Noise> temperature in your body a major way to learn to really go right direction once a source to decline that's associated with craziness and it hits its trough your body changes as lowest write about before you wake up right and that's actually associated with R E M sleep yet so the nurse and some stuff certainly come out just because everybody relaying the groundwork so your body temperature changes as the hype with alum as is directing the whole thing and sleep and wakefulness has something to do it's related to your body temperature changes right tonight you take it from here well you know let's take a break because Suresh ago we'll be right back in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> The <Music/Noise> my friend I

coy that stage very nicely so if your body gets to say some bad bacteria gets in it yes and your body is alerted warning intruder coming your immune system kicks into gear and starts producing this bio chemical material cut a pie region ok this is my new favorite thing the body thus yeah yeah well you knew that before right or just another mechanism I mean I knew humans get fevers and I knew the fever was a cowboy cookout everything didn't understand the mechanism must answer ques will take this pardon me yeah so these pie urgent right they are biochemical markers that are released by the immune system and the body or this is why I love this there's some bacteria some pathogens that make humans sick that produced by regions naturally yet so when <Music/Noise> up they just are releasing a mean and they just give themselves away yet it's their big Dummies in that way right there like a where's the party they kick open the door yet picturing like a pony keg <Music/Noise> yet their guts taken out yet just that's that's like that kind of bacteria right so the pie regions enter the bloodstream they travel to the hype without mess because remember the hype with Elmer's controls your um your body temperature and this is what they do Chuck are you ready for the Pirates in stew yes they go do you have to tell us and they stamp in the heat sensing neurons in the hyper found this and they excite hold sensing neurons and you have a Thomas the trick your hype with elements into thinking your body suddenly gotten very very cold yet so they hype with elements turns the temperature up and says Don't let any of this heat out we have warm back up it tricks your body is your hope to thousands including a fever that's right and they do this because well they don't do this because what happens from there it is because of dumb but what happens from there it's like you said the fever the fever is why you want that fever for at least a little while that does it's it's trying to cook and burn and bake that bacteria until it dies right is your body's fighting like when you hear you now like your fever broke it's usually good sign that mean yeah right that your fever did its job and it's cooked all that bacteria up in your are going to be on the mend soon yeah so basically this was happening in this is the great thing about a fever but um you know fever makes you feel like crap because it's a lot of hard work to kill all those things well it is there's a lot of from your sympathetic nervous system is kicked into high gear which I found <Music/Noise> reason why they say you want to feed a cold starve a fever because you don't want to introduce digestion because it requires the para sympathetic nervous system right right fight or flight and you don't want those two things going <Music/Noise> has a fever just a lot of extra work for right but one of the things that is going on when your body has a fever when the temperature rises it's hard enough on your organs but it's also hard on the level just the fact that they're operating outside the <Music/Noise> operating temperature that makes a very <Music/Noise> them in can actually cook some of the ingredients inside your cells yeah I mean it's like work in a too hot of an environment is never fun for anyone right of the Some people of that stuff yeah but this tells them I like it but they still are working fast Buster you know they might be happy but there's oh so if you have a fever or what's considered a fever now and twenty seventeen if you're an adult and your aural temperatures above one hundred point four or if your rectal or ear temperatures above one o one and that's considered a fever if your kid good luck getting anything besides the rectal temperature is stuff you have basically no right which of his weekly kids who aren't like Sure Thing something in my ear for four seconds yet but the kazoo there's not really think about all they can use a glaze of India exactly so the rectal temperature for a kid above one hundred point four and with adults like you know have to really worry about your fever too much of the top one hundred and five for any period of time you probably want to do something about that that's what I saw was The hundred and five degree Fahrenheit mark was about where you should start or as an adult and you're gonna feel so awful if your temper five You've probably already been to a doctor that point let's hope so for kids is different if you don't want to let your child get up to one of five that's bad bad bad so what is it for kids that you really want a story about you say you know I'm <Music/Noise> exactly sure I mean it probably depends on where their first time parent or this is her second well and it varies with age you know it's like zero to eighteen months that something just like we should do is console that your doctor yeah exactly but any kind of temperature you should for a childish and can be little more alert about it but we're not medical expert no not everything are saying assumes that you have healthcare coverage I hate them that's fever in general anything else on that yeah one other thing the Pirate since I wrote a mistake man did have some coincidence no it's not what is a line for fire Greek word for fire yet pyro Pete def Leppard a great song really is <Music/Noise> it is mention in Rock of Ages comes up they should have a song called fire me and wonder but that's pretty cool it's like the antithesis of your band or album and your song all being the same name like Big Country oh I love that song sure but pretty creative you're basically saying like here's our basket and we're going to put everything <Music/Noise> one one thing we came up with I saw David stayed at once and he was talking about his complaining it was even comedies is complaining that he went sub big country and they didn't play the song big kind know <Music/Noise> really like it said in a mature band it's the one song everybody came to see if the plan is funny well the long slow long and short of it is I totally forgot what the other thing I have to say about pirates and probably think of it oh I know it was tired since as you are immune system grows in ages <Music/Noise> you become a grown up the tires is have a <Music/Noise> less of an effect on you so if your kid in your immune system is young and inexperienced your fever is going to shoot up quick and it's going to get hotter faster <Music/Noise> to say on top of the kids feel <Music/Noise> the system is not used to Pi regions come in and messing with the hope of Falmouth adults is a little spike in fact it's good point that I was thinking yeah it's true we need to take the I think that rectal temperature way more than you're comfortable with I don't recall that <Music/Noise> well because you don't remember being a baby know that my parents are pretty strict stern about the time a kid is old enough to where you can say it like Hey put this on your tongue or hold still for minute walk with his inner ear yeah Prix that when their ninth synch and humans in there just you know crying whiny little sacks of flesh I guess he got a sticker at the butt ok here's last June was further Shore most Allen recently that she knows ok so into dreams and I always think we've done a general show and dreams I think we did finally I didn't find it was still no lucid dreaming can you control your dreams it's the same thing when I think maybe <Music/Noise> we we did one on dreams wow I can't believe it I can't believe it well this contributes to little by little someone will know ok Phil Hurley where are you or statistician ministers that's right I will talk about dreams of it here then even though Heath explain this in various episodes here and there to some degree but dreams you know if your psychologist use you really love to spend time talking and dissecting dreams interpreting dreams if you're a mom more into the neurology side of science you really care about the kind of stuff in fact for many years they thought it was called activation synthesis hypothesis which was go to sleep and all these synapses are just randomly firing and they don't really add up even a story you just do that when you wake up because you're human yeah I mean that's complete BS so you almost get the impression that they came up with this in the neurologists came up with it to stake out their territory in response to years of psycho analyst saying this is what dreams are like tapping into the collective unconscious are there your repressed memories neuroscience said no nothing just your hse have been wet brain going crazy while you sleep which we all know now is not true I saw another one to that threat simulation theory of year don't know that that's a great band name basically it's your training <Music/Noise> you sleep like your brain <Music/Noise> threat simulations constantly so that it's like working itself out like getting more more agile and quick in leading the league seeking a better running from a saber tooth tiger if you actually encounter can see that early on may be sure and there is an evolutionary advantage to oso evolutionary speaking they would make sense the point is it that Alan came along I was like No there's obviously some reason for dreams it's not as random yet well and then maybe I could've seen that early on that then at some point someone around the fire had a dream about tactics wife woke up and went whoa those in a saber tooth tiger not sure what that meant but I better not to look and then they went with a rectal thermometer I hadn't <Music/Noise> invented yet so these days they've done actual studies with ECG machines in MRI machines and especially in Italy these Italian researchers basically put people to sleep put him to sleep for whole lay them down and the nice tie in bed even some pasta puzzle and of the rectal thermometer and they hook him up to all these wires and machines and then <Music/Noise> wake them up at different points in the night and say hey what were you dreaming of him we'd like to talk about it and said he was going on with these machines right and um they actually what they found supports the current the prevailing theory I don't think is their theory think it was around that their research supports it called FX deregulation theory which is basically that we control our emotions are we process our emotions through our dreams yeah and these Italians found support for this and that when they woke people up and ask them what they were dreaming about the ones who had the best recall where the ones who are the most Theta waves in their frontal lobes right which are slow moving waves right yes and when you look in an <Music/Noise> machine if you look that those dreamers brain waves it looked like the brain waves as somebody who is sitting there forming and recalling memories Rice of these people said that's what they're doing that's what all of us are doing while <Music/Noise> were forming memories were taking emotions that we experience through the day and we are creating <Music/Noise> out of them so we can file <Music/Noise> so we're processing their emotions in our dreams that's the point of dreams that's the current understanding yeah and then I mean other parts of the brain that have been active all sort of deal with emotion whether it's the middle and the hippocampus or the Lingle J Iris which I think we just talked about in another so that your call can remember them but they're all areas of the brain that relate to emotion and memory right and some with visual activity an African make sense like that theory and <Music/Noise> the current theory so it's likely the explanation for regular dreams and you can't just have a theory for dreams without including nightmares or else are theories broken right so the affix regulation theory considers nightmares basically it's an emotion that's being put into the process of being of creating <Music/Noise> a false memory and remembering I guess you put it but it's a real emotion right and it's so big it breaks the process and all of a sudden this process of creating a fake memory of fake experience goes haywire and all the sudden you are <Music/Noise> some terrible horrifying experience because the emotion that was being processed was too big and got out of control and now you have a nightmare TS for you could in one night terrors we did for sure and sleep paralysis we've covered all I think I guess we really haven't and dreams one writes Let's take another break come back and finally talk about fever dreams the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> Chuck did you know that cooking together build

as saying that I was wrong so check here is where everything is kind of goes totally off the rails we talked about fevers talked about nightmares the problem is really understanding both doesn't necessarily amount to understanding them together right so knowing the fevers are no where dreams are doesn't mean you know a fever dreams are but he makes stuff up if you want yeah and I'm boy don't even think we even said if you've never had a fever dream I know are talking about oh yeah and um this point the podcast but the fever dream is um basically a nightmare on steroids yeah it's just so vivid and so real and scary right that happens you know when your sick with a fever yes so they're fugitives and so they are a thing yet but the scientific literature on them is super thin yet silly non existence did seem to get them if not more at least they stand out more children bright and so anecdotally people seem to recall having fever dreams more when they were kids right whether or not this true or just a memory as or you know the collective memory bias whatever yeah this no nos well yeah I mean we don't really know is I don't remember the last"

thanks to timely for me to brain surgery from the What the heck is going on Sirius yes exactly very underrated there's <Music/Noise> um the wild west on to oh yeah he once killed a man just for snoring too loud and a big impact on me yeah I don't snore but did like the or two once you really think it's either too for a while those kind of it really is I can kind of um well there is a there is a book it's still in print as far as I can tell it's called Le its life time life because I think time went on with Warner and AOL now which by the way someone a Time Life Time Warner said that the acquisition of AOL was one of the worst mistakes in the history of business recently it's not nice de but there is a life book called The Greatest mysteries of all time the actors are great in this like a top fifty and it's things like um was Anastasia alive Princess Anastasia she escaped the Bolshevik Revolution comp am who would this are really a mystery to figure that out yet no no <Music/Noise> it's okay yeah I was you know they got though unless we can go there actually if you pay for plane tickets um there's Jack the Ripper are phased in and among them as she should be in all lists of the greatest unsolved mysteries is <Music/Noise> Earhart right um in two thousand and seven we saw the seventieth anniversary of her disappearance and she just kind of flew into history and <Music/Noise> about it last summer um and I was really shocked to find that there's a lot of pieces in place that if one thing we'd change we'd know for sure what happened to her but still this mystery and doers and it drives people crazy and makes them want to go people spend tons of money and time and efforts are to try to figure out what happened and some people come up with some theories that are interesting um one was that she was actually captured by the Japanese is ready for war to write prisoner they work an adversarial of what they leave <Music/Noise> the Japanese actually helped with her search to the center but that is a theory that stills going on as she was captured by the Japanese either executed or forced into servitude to become Tokyo Rose who has a group of English speaking women who basically said Gee I go from back home is having sex with Captain America and Superman bright I know it's true they said things along those lines as this that's good um another one is that there was a alien abduction that's what I'm saying to have you heard of Irene Craig mobile and yes that was the apparently those one theory that Amelia Earhart just assumed the life of a New Jersey housewife of by that name a successful banker who retired to becoming teachers the housewife is a <Music/Noise> she had a pilot's license in the thirties there's a lot of stuff that um she actually had a mutual friend with Amelia <Music/Noise> singer in a same circles now and not much is known <Music/Noise> before World War Two she kind of appears at uno are supposedly so allege this guy who was about to release a biography in nineteen seventy saying this lady is Amelia <Music/Noise> the woman sued an one one point five million dollars and the book was never published a belief interesting yet but the guy was relentless after she died he asked to be able to photograph and fingerprint her body really in the family is like no but he's taking it like exactly why would <Music/Noise> that because it's years before she's buried his training under either theory Josh I'd like to hear to have a theory that if you asked one thousand people who Fred Noonan was that nine <Music/Noise> have no idea you're talking yeah I have <Music/Noise> was until I researched this Fred Noonan was in the plane in the <Music/Noise> Electra as the navigator that went down on July second nineteen thirty seven are supposedly when the mind of seeing if there's a picture of him and their heart and he is the quintessential old time the <Music/Noise> with his button down shirt buttoned all the way it all he's got like some papers in his front shirt pocket protector his um his his pants are pulled up to just below his um his Naples just looks like he's like all business as who I would definitely end his good guy apparently there was before before they went off on their um equatorial trip around the world explain to people because some people might <Music/Noise> backstory we <Music/Noise> but what they were trying <Music/Noise> Sir can navigate the globe along the equator along the equator long as you can possibly take to get around the right obviously <Music/Noise> they did this in installments but they were definitely not doing it in installments of four hundred miles a pop know and by this time we should also say this nineteen thirty seven when the they undertook this trip but by this time you <Music/Noise> already like this worldwide <Music/Noise> famous for sure she was a well known pacifist which is pretty cool she was <Music/Noise> rights advocate very cool like women can do anything they guys can do kind of thing right she was a stunning contrast though apparently like um she's one of her friends had given her a fifty fifty chance of surviving this trip and she actually agreed with it she'd said that she <Music/Noise> for self because she maintain this um this what she called the famine in conceit that she was afraid of aging right she wasn't <Music/Noise> about diamonds is worried about Fred <Music/Noise> like you this nice guy with the family <Music/Noise> and she was right to worry because on July <Music/Noise> second nineteen thirty seven The disappeared off the face of the earth which are seen as she had guts of steel <Music/Noise> deal she'd already <Music/Noise> The Flying Cross by Congress she received the National Geographic award from President Herbert Hoover mom sues the first woman to cross the Atlantic ten years before she broke in an altitude record shoes is the first woman to fly around <Music/Noise> wow all this in in about a ten or twelve year career all the stuff so when she disappeared the whole world noe yy it was big big news yeah and <Music/Noise> she <Music/Noise> we'll talk about where she disappeared broadly because they still don't know for sure which is one of the problems she departed in her Lockheed Electra which is to me one of the coolest looking planes ever built yeah shiny silver just really cool complaint and she departed <Music/Noise> Papa New Guinea yes New Guinea to probably skip the Kiri outbreak really that silly place that that is found well they departed lied to <Music/Noise> I for one <Music/Noise> stretches of this of this flight and they <Music/Noise> setting out for Howland Island which was about twenty five hundred <Music/Noise> from when they were going right to consume the stuff they'd already flown most the way around the world there we <Music/Noise> yet and this is the longest stretch yet it was also um it was going to eat up a lot of that last seven thousand miles is twenty five hundred miles from Papua New Guinea to Howland Island in Howland Island itself was pretty small amount in half by half mile yes tiny little hole in it only rose twenty feet out of the Pacific Ocean in basically the tolls out there in the Pacific just basically columns coming out of the ocean floor and that's it there's like no shelf on either side yet eternal in on a postage stamp I would think right in it was very apparent to everybody including Noonan and Earhart and the U S Coast Guard in government this is a very dangerous this is probably the most dangerous leg of the journey so they had a Coast Guard cutter the task A who is tasked with tracking them it was it s good right and they also had two additional ships for markers to help her along so she wasn't just completely <Music/Noise> were trying to keep up with her because everyone you know clearly <Music/Noise> and a steak and her being successful and I say her and Fred poor Fred he just he never can see it's you know no one even knows who yet known as who is so Fred was trying to use celestial <Music/Noise> so we can do that they fell out of radio contact and at dawn the task I picked up a transmission where she said that Noonan kind of figure that they were should be just over where they were <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> of the shore of Howland Island right but apparently <Music/Noise> and the Lockheed Electra in a <Music/Noise> there is no trees <Music/Noise> that they were way off in about an hour after that they need the fuel <Music/Noise> after that they get the final transmission from her which basically just said we are running north to south knows her last words that anyone ever heard or said Chuck did you know that cooking together build strong family bonds and in fact research shows that blue apron families cooked nearly three times more often than <Music/Noise> apron families yes I did know that because we're a blue apron family blue aprons

apron a better way to cook so about the time um the news got back that they never showed up to Howland Island and President Roosevelt who is a friend of hers he also was a great admirer of hers is well ordered massive search by the Navy to members of the Japanese helped as well CEOs of multinational search and rescue mission that covered a quarter <Music/Noise> square miles yes there is a huge huge area yet taxes is a little less than two hundred <Music/Noise> thousand so it's just slightly less than the state of Texas and is open water that they're searching yes um they stand on <Music/Noise> know the old joke is look at all that water in the reply is Yes the top of it right that's when the problems yeah exactly you're scanning <Music/Noise> the size of Texas and what possibly lies beneath all that right and um but you're hoping that if if the thing broke up you'd find some wreckage some sign of life some floating sure they found nothing no nothing that they could link to air horn in like they just disappeared in actually FDR took a lot of flack we should say because he spent four million bucks in the middle of the Great Depression just to search for this one person died or will these two people see poor Fred Noonan and um but he always stood by that as far as I know um again though is a fruitless search and they turned up nothing right thing to be a great band name <Music/Noise> that but poor Fred Noonan that's a good one remember that sell cheap over breaks up after the Navy search they basically discontinued their search and said <Music/Noise> can't find or infrared and we're going to send a destroyer out to Gardner <Music/Noise> was called Gardner on back then and now it's nice tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow and they did this because radio transmissions on her frequency were being broadcast in that area there are which is pretty substantial this is an <Music/Noise> yeah and um this is still an unexplained aspect of this mystery there are sporadic bursts of radio transmissions him no and still can say why they were there from some guiding Fred Noonan said it's exactly like he's there isn't a millionaire heiress is a swimmer so they basically it's in a couple of dispatch planes into that aisle and found nothing in said Wright were calling off this area she's not <Music/Noise> no evidence of life write an ode been and that was nineteen thirty seven night yet and the planes went back to the destroyers <Music/Noise> carrier and west and that that that wouldn't that probably <Music/Noise> the association between Gardner <Music/Noise> our nica in a coma row and <Music/Noise> had it not been colonized by the British in nineteen thirty eight had it not been for their penchant for colonization yes period of British imperialism didn't exist this probably these these artifacts ever were to turn up but they're there how they like to colonize the things they colonize this remote outpost actually gathered up some other <Music/Noise> nearby and said hey you <Music/Noise> and when these Islanders on an island they found evidence that a Castaway had been there yet recently they found some pretty jarring stuff right Chuck yeah <Music/Noise> most certainly a Castaway because they found a woman <Music/Noise> Man Chu Rite liquor bottle Jolla in a container for a Sexton which is one of those you know those are the cool looking navigation device that you hold up it looks like some minor league OF extraordinary <Music/Noise> which Fred Noonan had on the plane with them of course it yes Fred and then they also found and certainly not the least of which would be human skull and Bones here's here's where this thing would be it's just done probably in my opinion where they'd say this is them yeah um they found one set of human remains the Islanders took this to the governor <Music/Noise> in <Music/Noise> Gerald O I can remember is Jill Gallagher thanks buddy yeah they took it to Gerald Gallagher Gallagher says I suspect I know this is as good a physician looking at this the physician examined and the bones are promptly lost forever going <Music/Noise> happened to likely this position took pretty methodical notes and wrote descriptions and drawings of the bones and so in the ninety some forensic anthropologists got their hands on these notes and they said pretty much unequivocally that these bones where the bones of a woman of northern <Music/Noise> ancestry bingo who is about five foot seven and <Music/Noise> was five for eight well they haven't well you would think they're off by an inch it wasn't her but in this teenager had to have DNA evidence pro and contra heard of Lee rancher so the bones go missing we can get a DNA match but consider that on an uninhabited island right where they think the immune <Music/Noise> have gone down the remains <Music/Noise> a woman <Music/Noise> European ancestry who is pretty much the same height and <Music/Noise> heart were found a few years after disappearance I say score I say scores game set match but they also found some other cool stuff and the area <Music/Noise> was called Seven site and that was the little encampment that they believe was used by them and they found some other cool stuff like clam shell fragments that I'm basically they were smashed open by somebody write an expose the fire which you know unless they are struck by lightning that's pretty much definitive evidence of human use well yeah and they also found bones of fish and birds and turtles that had been exposed to fire another it's a mess cooking up something to eat yeah what else they found they found <Music/Noise> pieces of bottle it shows signs of uses a cutting and sawing tools yeah um they also found a little piece of a knife um which they managed I don't know how they did this huge semi this link there's a picture of just the knife blade and they won back a man is to identify it as a type of jack knife yes those produced within this time period by this company <Music/Noise> so it was it was produced in late nineteen thirty in nineteen forty two or something like that score and then they went back this year this group called the We should say their name yet the International Group For Historic aircraft Recovery or TR they've been I think three or four different times <Music/Noise> stay silent they went the summer <Music/Noise> this they are preparing the expedition and they found the rest of the knife and this is where they hope to get DNA evidence from well yeah not the reason that the knife by discovery is important for the rest of the knife they originally found the blades <Music/Noise> and then they found the knife the summer and it showed that the knife blades have been forcibly <Music/Noise> from the knife indicating that maybe they took each blade to maybe and of course are speculating that maybe to attach it to end of a spear or something like that for fishing Castaway knows what that's all taken by the way they also found Gardner <Music/Noise> became uninhabited in nineteen sixty three there is a prolonged drought and British government were just like to forget it everybody just leave and the with the group take heart when they went to excavate around there they found in this abandoned village folk art made of aluminum aircraft metal right which they can't definitively prove came from her plane ride obviously come has a lot of circumstantial evidence of female Castaway handicrafts or maybe Tom use the craft again but they're um I don't think Tom made I think Amelia <Music/Noise> it Thomas kill an impact or drowned and Amelia made it to the island and die there alone quite possibly she may have even eaten him there is a new theory I think it was launched and a cousin with the disappearance of the Neanderthals that's right they melted the <Music/Noise> snow Josh when it came time for my wife and I did buy our house and we never bought a house before men to be honest we were kind of apprehensive a little scared because we didn't really know what we're doing yes the whole thing can be kind a terrifying and awe sure but you know what you have confidence your life doesn't mean you're not confident maybe you feel good about work maybe feel good about playing guitar riding a surfboard you should feel that good about getting a mortgage right unfortunately there are very few places where you can feel that good but we can tell you about one of them and that is rocket mortgage by Quicken loans like a mortgage gives you the same level of confidence when it comes to buying your home or refinancing your existing home loan you have elsewhere in your life or you feel in control you know that's right with rocket mortgage you can apply simply understand fully so you can mortgage confidently that is the key to get started go to rocket mortgage dot com slash stuff you'll be pleasantly surprised equal Housing lender license in all fifty states in M L S consumer access dot org Number three zero three zero or rocket mortgage dot com slash stuff today and take the stress of finding <Music/Noise> time you were <Music/Noise> that they've recently <Music/Noise> because they're trying to get some DNA called touch DNA off of the few <Music/Noise> submitted ten <Music/Noise> a hundred one of the reasons why finding that knife is very important huge because I believe this minute the blades and then they found some class from <Music/Noise> looked like a cosmetic star and a couple of buttons and they submitted these things to place in Canada and I think as of today I still don't think they have the results of that DNA testing done that or is that they haven't done yet <Music/Noise> But they would have such enormous news that we would have known that I think some chalk there's a lot of people out there who also think that her plane Survey survived intact and is at the bottom of the Pacific that's awesome and people still think Tigger included um undertake sonar searches of the ocean bottom and there's a good chance that the plane did make it um they were flying supposedly at about a thousand feet which is extremely low yeah they're doing <Music/Noise> which is pretty slow for a plane especially a Lockheed Electra so conceivably didn't necessarily bust into a million pieces right now so it's possible it still out there at the bottom of the ocean well I am totally sold and I said like every single Jack the Ripper killer we brought up yeah he sounds like the guy but I'm completely convinced that this is where she spent her last this like you initiate Fred Noonan I don't know that her friend for Fred we should also mention too that they use a new well is new to them at least ground penetrating <Music/Noise> GP are for the first time on this last trip the summer and that is when you can actually look beneath the surface for anything that was buried like Fred it's magic and they they didn't find anything though because not because I was <Music/Noise> but there are lots of roots in air pockets underneath the thing I get the feeling that this looks since you're looking for some very look for pockets of air and so that was completely inconclusive through the oceans may have also pulverized to his bones to cover up for abomination I P So yeah I wonder that I think is what happened I wonder <Music/Noise> though I wonder if it was weeks or months or what well considering I mean if her plane went down in nineteen thirty seven and they started calling rising in nineteen thirty eight she lasted less than a year but can you imagine if you like just gave up and then like a week later the British come to colonize Gardner <Music/Noise> is now I mean how horrible would that is a she she made it less than a year she made it to garner <Music/Noise> make a Moreau what I'm surprised about it maybe she tried <Music/Noise> and Fred tried to do this I'm surprised he didn't leave something behind like instead of doing handicraft maybe try and scratch the name Amelia into the aluminum and <Music/Noise> or something or maybe its something is there and some found it yet as it reduces Crow with tone on it she is a history buff Amelia was here well that's uh that's it as a stand so far ha you think will ever do an update if the finer we always say we will and we <Music/Noise> do so the answer the question is no if you wanna <Music/Noise> Earhart and see a picture of how cute for newness in this little pool time The <Music/Noise> get up and type their heart into the search bar house to fix the Comets D A R H A R T s bringing up I would think unless we have articles in <Music/Noise> I guess its time and for listener memory the <Music/Noise> going <Music/Noise> her rehab experience is quite <Music/Noise> and I've got one time <Music/Noise> jumper and has come along this is from Scott in two thousand and five he had pretty much worked himself into a rehab hospital he was working three different jobs hit a wall couldn't the sidewalk this where <Music/Noise> pick up a pencil so he went to the E R After fifteen minute <Music/Noise> psychiatrist he said was quite attractive mature height of that he said she left and <Music/Noise> came to stand outside <Music/Noise> she said No you're not just going to take a break he said You need to be checked then and this <Music/Noise> two Hour Hold your doctor decide your risk so that's what happened to him initially next I wound up in an ambulance for a trip to a psych lockdown ward called Station twenty two cents at the beginning <Music/Noise> bad movie a horror film you into who exactly they drop me off behind too heavily locked doors in the next <Music/Noise> was relieved <Music/Noise> belt now I should say I was not suicidal <Music/Noise> really out of ideas <Music/Noise> Anthony out of ideas the cues he was indecisive we could and now I think he means he was burned out having a nervous breakdown out of options <Music/Noise> yet sounds like it's been eight days of Station twenty two and saw some interesting things <Music/Noise> a meth addict was admitted she looked like she should <Music/Noise> and ten two hundred and twenty pounds but she weighed more like eighty she took one drink <Music/Noise> juice promptly dropped to the floor like a second bones and this <Music/Noise> a code red was the crash cart ye are in the whole parade after leaving Station twenty two a transfer to a place in the suburbs for twenty eight day program was pretty cool <Music/Noise> author and many other fascinating people <Music/Noise> sneaking out <Music/Noise> whole thing had to bear the AA <Music/Noise> and I totally understand Sandra Bullock and twenty eight days now the other big <Music/Noise> a guy who wrote A Million Little pieces I was coming the next week because he'd stay there before when he was running the book and over people came on site Orkut camera locations in blocking and <Music/Noise> two days before they were to descend the I made up scandal occurred so never showed clearly <Music/Noise> just a few other little tips people in <Music/Noise> think there's a definite link between sugar <Music/Noise> everyone seemed to want to hook up with something sweet <Music/Noise> the heroine sickness looks worse than dying in a fire wow it's been pretty bad huh and a surprising number of people were repeats I'm talking like Yeah this is my seventh time here and <Music/Noise> of people snuck off for a drink got kicked out so <Music/Noise> much better now he is back on <Music/Noise>"
