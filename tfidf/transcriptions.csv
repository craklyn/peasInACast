"1","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After

peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer

"2","EOFire Podcast","David_Shriner-Cahn_5.22.17_3.mp3","what's shaking <Music/Noise> in a jail the here and <Music/Noise> to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty seven of Scio Fire right I would today's most inspiring entrepreneurs seven D The week in goals equal success Fire Nation <Music/Noise> with the Freedom Journal you'll be accomplishing <Music/Noise> goal in one hundred days now show tees feature guest David Schreiner on David are you prepared to eat and I sure am John yes Dave is the go to authority in how to smash a business plateau felt by experience on from yours in professionals he's the speaker consultant and host of the podcasts smashing the plateau he's dedicated to helping business leaders remove the roadblocks that are keeping them from fully achieving their goals and David take a minute fill some gaps from that and Sean give us just a glimpse of your personal life sure so John I started my professional life as a chemical engineer believe it or not <Music/Noise> in Chemical Engineering from core now works as an engineer for a few years and realized that it really wasn't for me long term and I ended up going into leadership and management roles in small to midsize nonprofit organizations did that for over twenty years learned a lot about leadership and management and then decided it was time to launch David and I became an entrepreneur in two thousand and six and since then I started my my entrepreneurial journey as a single person in management consulting business mainly focused on what I had left behind which was the non profit sector and started to pick up some private business clients and things more from them one said in a dive more into your journey coming up here given that the four wheeled kind of curious what you think now today is your area of expertise to break that down force yeah so what I've discovered is that leadership is really lonely there are in particular if you look at somebody who's an experienced leader and take somebody who might be in his or her forties or fifties and that person looks ahead at what he or she dreams to achieve before their story ends you know they've got several decades probably of significant activity and impact they want to make on the world and if for some reason they have hit a roadblock and the gap between where <Music/Noise> and where they want to end up is not getting smaller but in fact it's getting bigger and they look around at what their peers seem to be achieving and frankly social media makes it seem like everybody other than us is achieving breakthroughs all the time that can cause a lot of freaking out and especially for people who are experienced tricks that they use in the past if they're not working it just heightens the anxiety so there's certain things that those people in those scenarios are unlikely to feel comfortable talking to anybody who's close to them that they're not going to talk to their employees because they're the lead of this post to have all the answers they're not going to talk to and they're probably not if they have partners they may not feel comfortable talking to their partners about certain things and if they have investors are probably not going to talk to their investors about these issues and if there's a significant other in their lives spouse or other kind of significant relationship lot of times and I can feel comfortable talking about those issues with their significant other or their significant other may not want to hear them so it's very <Music/Noise> had to use som these kinds of problems that are really complicated as you know leadership is hard work and breakthroughs don't happen quickly they generally happen after lots of steps so what we've done is break breaking down that process so that you can understand what is you need to do and frankly what I've also seen is that there's been an explosion in the coaching industry and there seem to be so many people who are offering help and very frequently that kind of help is not the right kind of help for you so one of the things I've discussed with with three hundred or so podcast guests that I've had on is where <Music/Noise> received grace to help and when I heard over and over again is when you're in a community <Music/Noise> like minded peers who are serious about success committed to a long <Music/Noise> process of mutual support and non judgmental then that dynamic will support innovation and here's why when you listen to the challenges and experiences of others they'll teach you strategies and strategies and tactics that you'll be able to use and I'll give you a couple of examples somebody who's an entirely different industry than your own may be working on a similar kind of problem may have experiences similar similar kind of problem that is applicable to you like let say you hear a story of somebody who's working on contract negotiation and then few weeks later you're working on a contract negotiation and office <Music/Noise> light bulb go off and you realize Oh I can apply what I heard my friend use in a difficult contract negotiation so I lose my shirt and this deal or you might hear somebody who has done a great job growing her profits in an industrial company that inspires you to take a new strategy to grow your profits in a B to B service company so those are great ways for you to be able to apply lessons that other people have learned to your own sector and secondly the act of needing to prepare to explain your challenge to group forces you to unpack things in a way that explaining it to a single person whether that person is a coach or somebody else is not quite the same that the preparation alone can make you realize that you <Music/Noise> the solution in the third step is when you're with a trusted group of peers and you really open about what is challenging you you'll get powerful group thinking you'll hear most of all ways that you can potentially overcome your Roebuck Fire Nation only taken away from this number one is patience you need to have patience like things are not going to happen overnight like you see the social media is out there and everybody's having a huge win these big launch is all these mental breakthroughs emotional breakthroughs business breakthroughs you seen the snapshot you seen all the hard work that went into creating that the combination of a lock at first opportunity all of the sayings comes with you having patience you're going to get to those moments but you have to be patience number two the mastermind if you don't have a group of people the you know like and trust they're going to push you to hold you accountable to support you and guide you then you're struggling and you continue to struggle that's why I and everyone of these episodes by saying hey even hang out with XYZ <Music/Noise> D today so you know you have to fight the police been the most time was theirs to your five Keep up the heat fire nation like gotten find other people one two three four five other people they can to keep that energy on them to keep those lights are going to ignite that excitement within <Music/Noise> David you had a lot of reading your life that's the evidence all the great breakthroughs and Alvin Wiley success and what outcome want you to take us to right <Music/Noise> be what you consider your worst entrepreneurial moment today to take us to that moment David that day tell us that story what happen well the story actually is a pre entrepreneurial moment it was when I left engineering nights spent seven years studying engineering and worked for a few years as I mentioned and when when I <Music/Noise> that it was going to work out that the pivot happened after I was in my second job that two years in the company that I was working for didn't have enough business and a month after I got really great performance review and a big raise my boss calls me into his office and says David have bad news for you nothing to do with your ability your or your performance but you're out of a job and I'm like What am I gonna do that when I was in my late twenties and had expenses et-cetera You know the story a lot of soul searching and in fact I was reflecting on as I was preparing for our discussion today and realize that it was the power of the mastermind tight group that was well facilitated that involve some learning that I was in that propelled me to be able to make a pretty profound change and ignore the naysayers around you thought I was crazy to go into the nonprofit world and that led to a long and very rewarding career that also set the stage for me to have the confidence in the capability to be an entrepreneur that started in two thousand and six Chinese <Music/Noise> the time onto the new ship is risky and you know what let's be frank her some risky things about becoming a notch when you are but how about <Music/Noise> skill and relying on an industry or sector or company or even just a boss for your well being and if that one a those things the industry the company the boss any of those things doesn't work out for a number reasons they are holding this brown paper bag that's just filled with one's skill inside this one skill now what do you do that you would try to find exact same job that you probably aren't the exact same situation this is a different world we live in now and has not been your yes is risky forty doing like you're building up this Swiss Army knife set of skills where one thing happy you could on other roads I mean I've shifted so many times from communities to coaching to products virtually to physical products you know I'm making other ships right now I've recently made my declaration fitness and nutrition I mean you are which of the skill sets you have the power to take on the challenges in the risks are still going to be there the challenges and risks but you're going to be to handle those because you are not you're going to have the sporting guidance of Dave is talking so eloquently about here surround yourself with that mastermind so even just <Music/Noise> his brother one sentence what you want to make sure our listeners get from your worst moment always have a Plan B This is something that I tell people I know who or who are employees people who are entrepreneurs you've always got to have multiple scenarios that you're working on that you're ready to pull the trigger on a moment's notice if you need to sort of like we prepare for fire drill by knowing the steps we can take when there is a fire and as an entrepreneur or as an employee these fires happen and you gotta be prepared to pull the trigger and move quickly when the month when the moment is there and you need to do it yeah <Music/Noise> of the firefighters were hoping her asap and guess what we see the smoke and feel the heat you want to know it today I'll want to make that decision then let's talk about one of the greatest ideas the you that today he had a lot of the year so take us to one of those moments and a walk into the process leadership is lonely but it doesn't have to be lonely you need to be really clear to yourself What is you dream to accomplish and you need to make sure that you understand what success looks like to you and it's not just financial success and is not just business success as you mentioned John you're working on other areas of your life beyond your business we're trying to make some changes and make some improvements we all have these areas to be really clear what successes look like in every area of your life and then make sure you understand what the key performance indicators are so you <Music/Noise> you can measure how successful you are so as not just a bunch of mush right sort of rolling <Music/Noise> there's a way that you can actually measure improvement because leadership is hard work entrepreneurship is hard work success in life is hard work but if you know what the step by step process it is and you know what is your measuring sea can see how successful you are with each step you can constantly improve your tactics so that your success keeps moving forward what does success look like the Fire Nation literally you're listening to my voice right now ask yourself that question what does success look feel smell what is it like healing what does it all those things t o actual fact question if you have a great answer or he still struggling you know there's something to continue to think about and to journal about and meditate about whatever <Music/Noise> do actually think because so many people spend their days with their nose to the Christ only finally take a deep breath and we back in their share ten years later the light wow I was working so hard and this thing is getting me towards this goal this not even what success looks like to me and that when I really look down deep and they began to challenge your brother just a couple sentences I want <Music/Noise> but what does success look like T O having an impact on as many people as I can I love to see other people have these breakthroughs these aha moments when they realize that hey they had successes they've had more successes than they think they've had and be whatever seems like a daunting challenge today you can really you can look back on the tools you use for past excesses look at the resources you have around you look at your community look at your colleagues look at people in your mastermind and and take those some of those tools apply them to your challenges today and you can make those breakthroughs and I love helping people get through those breakthroughs was a little more selfish and not alive so I was to define success by a nation it would

whether the podcast social media videos physical products you name it and that's why love is the freedom to be able to do that to make that choice so what is success to you answer that question and I feel free to email <Music/Noise> O Fire dot com David what's the one thing that you are most excited about today I think that the Internet and technology has made it easier for the lines to blur between employment and entrepreneurship and between being a leader and being a follower if you look at leadership the way it worked a generation ago was primarily command and control we know that doesn't work anymore so there's a lot of ways that people can become leaders and a lot of ways people can move forward with entrepreneurship and the other hand that's also made it more complicated and often more challenging to be a great entrepreneur and a great leader and the things I most fired up about today is when I see people that take the time to have live face to face interactions because the technology that we have has made it less common for people to have face to face interaction and when I see people put all their gadgets down and spend time really focusing on <Music/Noise> powerful results happen so to fire nation in the world that we live in now has a meeting of G to break down these ease barriers <Music/Noise> is is no other time in grade fifty years ago you entered a

shockingly and <Music/Noise> you are in Episode one hundred and fourteen <Music/Noise> to the intro that episode and I was hysterical as far as like I was clueless you were still great in your <Music/Noise> you are so good then we had you back on it like it was a hundred episodes <Music/Noise> was too bad it was a long gap <Music/Noise> then eleven <Music/Noise> five then twelve forty seven and then fourteen seventy one season we kind of picked it up there and now it's seventeen twenty three so I think my niece's little confused about who's actually the host of your fire right now I think we've all gone from mediocrity to greatness now since I was a very old school once the COC God knows what's going on back to our little E knows there's a guy knows was going on I sure do now and I don't want to it's cringe worthy but Fire Nation David if you don't know yet is the creator of the rise to the topic and create awesome online courses helps people create and <Music/Noise> courses with thousands of students in over a hundred countries of all create a successful courses on everything from kindergarten teaching to snowboarding a lot of cool things we talking about later but even before we move onto other meats of this interview kind of filling some gaps in the snow was going on recently made father yet the Father times to know what <Music/Noise> I was coming I saw the boy and the girl you know I know everything is great here I mean it's funny because after discovering the world of online courses now got so many years on that now was like two thousand and ten two thousand eleven which in Internet years is like fourteen eighty three I write it's you watch this it's very funny cuz one of the big things for any business model or adding something to your business or go into a new business or whatever you're doing right is you have to have many good reasons wanna do it and it's funny because you know with courses are taught more about this but you know you get a lot of leverage to get a lot of time back in your business they would have a lot other very hands on business models where you're there every day right and it's funny as you start to his life changes like when I first started my course I wasn't I wasn't married yet right now I'm married and then years later now a cannon and other Can you say and your time gets more and more precious and different and it's just amazing that I know that I've got the backing of this business model that's what I always try to impart on other people as well it's not just about the amazing money in and helping people get results because that's what it's all about for sure are right but it's also about kind of taking control of your own business and so for me I get excited like no other kids coming oh great is that the system as couple of things in the business we're going to go you go you know we've got stuff that are running twenty four seven without me necessarily being there on and that's when the beauties of this so everything is fantastic career for sure one fire now did everytime I talk to Mike finally I get to talk to the person who's literally <Music/Noise> excited and enthusiastic to be a microphone as I am because Unitarian through the seventies weekend you know sometimes these people that get on the mike and they're just like Yeah <Music/Noise> like listen I need to just inject some fire fluid is you because you know that's actually why I would start every episode with Are you prepared to ignite because I want them to know that my ridiculous so they better get to my level or in now forget about Albion interrupting cow I five someone on the way out of Starbucks today just a random verse I was a high five and has walked away and I don't know what that person figuring out but

talk about how you are the average of the fi piece for the most time with you need to spend time with people that are signing up for these web in our period because they're the people you need to hang out with now she fired up because again this is happening on July thirteenth is two p m Eastern and we'll talk about these luscious die as to the benefits of horses yeah this is such a great topic as a lot of time for yourself why should you this right so if you're if you're listening Fire Nation which Meyer here and listen to jail the analyst Ray Cason you know you have a business some kind or thinking about starting one right out of pod casters here maybe you're in jail these podcast Paradise program on the biggest aspiring author speaker coach consultant all different things out there I'm just a quick contacts yet the mushy closing and just on a personal note here of kind of shoe milestones one is just about to crack seven million dollars in sales online courses come I'm super excited about and by the way before anyone likes to call out and say even if you teach courses on course is yes I do but I started the first several million were in completely other topic so so very important point that out on also we're getting close to nearly four thousand people in the summer courses program that I have and now which I loved this gives context for this we now have what we're calling a seven figure and a six figure club that start to fill up with people that have made seven figures with their online course and six figures with their online course and we now <Music/Noise> keys were getting several we have at least tentative cross of a seven figure mark recently likened this year yak on and we've gotten many more concerts have an exciting thing is teacher which kind of brings me the first benefit on and this is something that's so important and you'll notice right away when I talk about this job it is important that we're not talking about like some sketchy internet marketing we're talking offline about this about some new stuff online and you need change and want to say that sack now never do that right so my point of this so the first benefit is that online courses are the ultimate scalable way to help people get results and have a big impact right so think about that for second because the most successful online course traders come from a place of not only to have a great business of course but getting people results that put on my course is all about your job is of course creator is to get people from point A to Point B create change or transformation right at the most successful ones they come from that place that's what they're passionate about because you can only help people one <Music/Noise> much I know she'll be used to consulting ICU consulting don't do anymore right there's only so many people that you can help me doing one <Music/Noise> and there's only so many hours and at right so online courses offer a syllable way to have people get big results and in my opinion and this isn't just my pain is really fast on if you really want someone to take a transformation from point A to Point B entered into a product courses are the vehicle gay they're on no if ands or buts about that in fact I'm not going to poke fun of anyone even read it's really tempting it's not like I'm holding back there to pitch like ropes holding me back like I'm trying not to but there's some people out there some people out there that teach other business mouse is not a thing wrong with these business models but other types of business we can take your expertise or knowledge experience and turn into a product that's not of course but guess how they teach in jail they how the course re integrate irony of this world like me because the bottom line here is the courses are the top vehicle for teaching in transformation lines was the ultimate skill way to get people to get results on and that is the number one thing I want to talk tantrums benefits but we've got several more jail day for sure I'm excited <Music/Noise> this I knew the answer that question but <Music/Noise> I was playing the vibe was playing the violin to give <Music/Noise> a kindly played tennis I love it but I need to be for beginners to some other things are super important I mean you you had already fired com slash course or to register for this free master class you've been talking about wanting freedom and mash the general human holding off for some reason well freedom in mastery journals are literally going to be raining upon your head if you make it to this free master class lor see exactly why <Music/Noise> there's been over twenty four thousand feet and gentle soul I write next and what a perfect accompaniments I said that were perfectly accompaniments to crying of course using the freedom to create a course and the National <Music/Noise> thousand sales and this is a package deal by the way so there's just a ton of reasons to be there for all these things in D C What is another benefit it's funny because you don't even know it the second benefit was but has exactly what I like what you just mentioned is that it's actually about freedom right and it's to create a freedom based business now let's stop here let's pump the cliches let's not get high on Facebook with a rented Lamborghini pointing and saying you know in just one minute a day I got the celebrity right that is now what this is all about because I feel like this is honestly the most cliche things we hear about online it's like there's a pictures of people with laptops and beaches why the heck would you have your laptop at the beach by the way gets and the mass and also if you have a laptop to beat your freaking working at the beach which is good doesn't sound much fun I want to get an ocean swim around right so this is a very important thing a lot of us and if you win this vote to get into a business a lot of different reasons write like you want to make money on nope maybe have impact or or all the things and help people right but a lot of times you want freedom and you get the opposite effect in your business I was like that raining so I started out like this to be great if I could have my own schedule and do what I want when I wanted to talk about doing no work that's how I'm talking I'm talking about like actual like work when I want to I want to call every Tuesday Taco Tuesdays and I were just goes for twenty four hours you do that right that happening with me is I kind of became a slave to my own business right I had these big sponsors I was doing a podcast which you do be doing much better job of it we have five I was doing speaking I was doing consulting is always different things and I was working twenty four seven so now going vacation I would be yelled at by my wife basically twenty four seven as well because I had trouble unplugging and kind of on system I see something well with course is the creative freedom based business right you can make the rules the way they want because you're creating an asset you're creating a product you're selling a product is you in product form right on so when you do that you get to make the rules so like for me freedom is going to gym everyday until the day for two hours or not missing anything of my daughter's frantically happens you've got little events and she was at Hugo's turtle two year old gymnasts are huge but whatever as you know that's for me yours is whatever you want to be and I think that's another big benefit because just because we have an internet based business doesn't mean we have freedom a lot of times I know way too many people that have an internet based business that the computer twenty four seven like what's the fun in that so it's not that there's no work involved of course there's work and it's fun work but with horses you do you have the opportunity to create whatever the heck schedule you want and do it on your terms and a lot of you can also be automated as well I mean it has about the pop offer the same because foundation I just love <Music/Noise> we throw these master classes in as I get emails you know six months a year sometimes even six hours after you jump in one of these programs <Music/Noise> like John this is what <Music/Noise> to take freedom back into my life and to go on those vacations and actually prioritize me in my family and my health and my nutrition my fitness like this is where you why you're taking your life back and we have <Music/Noise> many value bombs that are coming your way right after we thank our sponsors looking to own <Music/Noise> maybe it's time to look into becoming an Allstate agency owner as an AG <Music/Noise> not just selling insurance policies you're building equity in the business with the opportunity to pass it down or someday sell the more than just an agent be an Allstate agency owner visits Allstate agent dot com slash he'll fire to learn more today subject to the terms of the agency agreements successful launch viewers know <Music/Noise> and accomplish goals those <Music/Noise> simply do not I have created a step by step guide for you to set your number <Music/Noise> and accomplish that goal in one hundred days allow me to introduce the freedom <Music/Noise> with over seventeen thousand sold to date the fee in general is the world's Number <Music/Noise> journal that will guide you in accomplishing <Music/Noise> and one hundred days with daily tasks daily recaps ten day sprint in quarterly <Music/Noise> you'll knock or that one big domino by day one hundred and begin a chain reaction of awsome to learn more visit the Freedom <Music/Noise> dock on Sunday she wore back and this is a couple things one run to real quick before I hand over to you for another benefits of <Music/Noise> is Number one Fire Nation five seekers to a successful online course this is a free master class and ESU myself are dropping for you this Thursday July thirteenth at two p m Eastern all you do is head over to heel Fire dot com slash course sign up you get a hysterical thank you video there's a huge gift there the dishes didn't <Music/Noise> yet he ends the freedom and mastery journals are literally be dropping on your heads during this training I'm going to be putting this back together this free international pack for everybody that comes in takes action at this master class so just wait the guys <Music/Noise> at your door soon after to the smashed glass and take action because that's what I want I want you to not just you know have a good two thousand seventy Lakeside to have an on fire two thousand seventeen the last thing I really <Music/Noise> is I L T is in vast learn and teach like you invest in yourself all the time fire nation through times like right now was into this you learn the contents like we're teaching today now it's time to turn around and teach in that's what this master classes can help you do have finally figured out that final T was his turn around and teach so David take away rather wacko all of that as well and that thing is also supporting know like there's a lot of trainees out there but I see I've got a team of spies it seems like every single training I love the lines <Music/Noise> Alpine you trust will find you everywhere but the thing is like they've seen and this is just unfortunate it comes with the territory right on is there's a lot of very bad advice out there on there's advice because of people that maybe they made their intentions are good like me don't have enough experience with and are maybe that they just teach in a way that was too unique to them unlike other people can relate to it right on and for me that's very important to note that when we talk about the secrets on that rainy it's not only what I've done to go from zero to now close to seven million dollars in sales of online courses but now nearly four thousand students served on a cross a border every different type of topic with every type of demographic and every type of background the boss imagined so it's it's based on that as well on so we were talking about benefits of course is that there's a lot of them but I think it's really cool is that upfront work get paid for years ok so now let's see are different as a spa like you're doing coaching are speaking great super fine right but every time you have to speak it to get on stage and speak right every time that you need to coax someone to go down there and do it over and over again there's nothing that yes you get do the same coaching yes you disdain speech over and over again but not creating a product not really an asset that you can sell on how the course you put in effort and then your online course is an asset to be sold again and again and again for years and years and years I mean even selling podcast paradise and Weber on fire for how many years that for years <Music/Noise> real quick I have made it very <Music/Noise> small of these to those I mean every time I need to make an update I do with all the time reinventing the wheel every couple months Fire Nation I created <Music/Noise> product I update the views of the updating <Music/Noise> but beyond that is just that initial investment that we needed right exactly because unlike a ounce looking for random things I in my office like this calendar <Music/Noise> ok let's say that this calendar and I sell a thousand calendars jelly and i realise i miss spelled July the calendar will be in big trouble or a liking to have a recall say it's like you know cars getting recalls up like that it's not so with all my courses because Allie creating a product an asset but something changes you want to make an update on you know some customers come and say Oh you know maybe this can be explained all the better you certainly have the easy option to flip on the camera right record a little update and pop it up there and that's another cool thing you have like a living breathing product and you don't have to redo from scratch like I can tell you how many students that we have on that continue to sell the same course is over and over again for three four and in some cases five years and even more on because you're creating a product that can continually be fresh and to go to a new audience we're very excited how long is part of life only Brown by Jeff Locke Grammy's a great guy but I mean that's been around for like twelve years <Music/Noise> eleven years this year's insane and in real quick is the story away you're talking about because the physical products this is true and this is scary I was going to print literally I was going to print for thirty thousand of the mastery journals was going to print like it was it was it was already <Music/Noise> I paid it was going to prance that day that was <Music/Noise> to start running through the machines <Music/Noise> got a letter and they said hey you can't call it self mastery journalists <Music/Noise> of itself nasty joke is there some stupid comedy out there they had some rice on the where self or something and I bought smile or he's like enforcing this is Kyla Jets what do you do and I was like shh was just in time so I like the ones of the mast regional dot com is available he said that that was clear so we printed thirtieth thousands of them were Street Journal I mean what's come on in. That's not <Music/Noise> courses just sayin' I'm sweating right now thinking about ideas she actually starts sliding over the course is to get change to ask and you can change it has something to his blatant self over and over and over again that super exciting and one more on that till the end I think this is another key benefit gala forget this one is was like I do not forget is on my last and I was like I got this call I forgot very upset about this we have to bring me back for my you know three hundred ninth time is and this is this is another one is not often talked about but it's very very important is that you don't need a huge amount of buyers to be successful with an online course ok so a lot of people have this illusion that you need to have ten thousand buyers are thousands of buyers to be successful with it ok now what's nice about online courses is a seller of premium say compared to any book or something like that right when you're teaching someone something so I <Music/Noise> map and geez I hope this is right eye by rascals are like them I can enter a town in CA I run out while the I eighty three calculator still makes fun out there but if you gets one buyer a day in tact for a course that sells for four hundred and ninety seven dollars Okay hundred and eighty one thousandfour hundred and five dollars a year hopefully I and when you think about that in perspective I mean if you're telling people I get ten thousand by Rs five thousand by Rs three thousand mice make it a success that can be a little bit intimidating regular Benton Harbor When I watch my first course on which is about doing online <Music/Noise> that's what I was doing at the time that for five years call me awesome interviews we only had four people that are marketed to in the very first launch jail they ended nineteen thousand eight hundred dollars in sales now that course is John did well over a quarter million much more and I was gone from air but only think that you know you have to have these thousands of eyes to be successful and what's nice about that is because courses sell for premium prices right compared to something a very low price of something very very low the dollar ninety nine or something like that right whatever is on us to get a huge amount of buyers to break six figures or seven figures with an online course not necessarily true at all you could run the math on that it's less than a buyer a day for ninety seven far last on to get you six figures you need <Music/Noise> thousand buyers for today on course yeah that's that's just the thought of that

worst moments his aha moment he crossed the lightning rounds of your lists and all that jazz is a good story as a good journey go back and listen to Episode thirteen hundred and eighty five but today we talking about reviews testimonials all that jazz <Music/Noise> really being a master class from Doran on is how you can make your business better for the services that his company provides an NYPD focus on certain things he might not be so just take it off with why should we even bother getting reviews and testimonials I think it goes without saying <Music/Noise> you look at a restaurant and a new location you not just going to roll a dice most people are going to pull up their smartphone going to bust out Yelp or go and they're going to do a search for local restaurants in is <Music/Noise> the best reviews we do that for restaurants we do it for resorts we do it for all kinds of products and services heck my sign because it is Big Dog Daddy forgot his teddy bear in the airplane I forgot it under the seat he was so perturbed and disturbed he was so upset with Daddy and then shes like ok I need a new teddy bear what did he do his five years old the time he sort of looking on Google and looking at reviews for teddy bears so it just goes to show yeah people really lean on reviews we want to avoid eleven we want to avoid the mistakes we regret not just for ourselves but also for the implications ramifications that that decision might make on friends or family members and sixty one percent of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase decision by get this seventy nine percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation from a friend or family member that was eight to ten people deem online reviews is just as influential in their buying decision making process as a recommendation from a friend or family member that's significant influence and that's why reviews <Music/Noise> critical would say right now I think reviews are mission critical I mean I really <Music/Noise> my time I think my time is very valuable but every single day Fire Nation I'm in the fifth in the field journal and in that original Facebook group this is private a spoof or just people have those journals we have great conversations <Music/Noise> with something new pops in and they say Oh my God I am <Music/Noise> the freedom or the <Music/Noise> or for any reason I take my time and I individually <Music/Noise> that person I say listen thank you Kathy Jo or Tom or Sarah thank you for commenting and it's in ensuring those kind words in the Facebook group I really appreciate that if you are my I really appreciate <Music/Noise> by their rules love <Music/Noise> because it just sounds so much and they give <Music/Noise> right there and one <Music/Noise> on one fine Asian I do that one on one and do that individually every single day I've done hundreds of those messages over the past few weeks I have over three hundred and forty five Star reviews for the field journal and the matches are always just got on Amazon a couple weeks ago already has forty and that sold me for my biz competitors have twelve sixteen is some of them <Music/Noise> three and a half stars of total rain breaking because they've been getting good and bad ones because Evan asking their best customers and clients for the good one so this is very valuable people make buying decisions every day on the scene just like the one was saying I don't know what I do share which was a tactic and a tool that works very effectively what are some other ways to get reviews on other ways what you're doing you know through manual human effort and let's face it it works perfect case in point that it works however if you want to really pour gasoline on the fire we want a system that works well we're not working so ideally we would have a system that ass for the review after certain amount of time I call it the MMS the moment of maximum satisfaction that's when you want to ask not when you haven't filled your promises but after you fulfill the promise of going experience of you that delightful in their jacked induced about the value they received there's usually <Music/Noise> moment that intuitively the best time to ask for the review so for you might be a certain period of time after they've gotten into your stuff answer to consumer stuff and good value for my stuff then we want to send him a text or an email or both and ask for the reviews so we need that trigger point and then when a system that submits the ask and then here's the big mistake a lot of people make in entrepreneurial realm as they go directly for the juggler and they ask for a view directly on <Music/Noise> site now I'm not pointing any fingers because it still works right but ideally we want to give the multiple auctions because here's the thing about getting reviews on Google <Music/Noise> or TripAdvisor <Music/Noise> of these places Amazon for that matter you need an account in order to give a review if you don't have an account you have to go through the hassle of creating one just to submit a review and that's why <Music/Noise> a hundred people for review typically only get five ten fifteen percent to use that request because they don't have an account and they love you but they don't love me enough to do those activities to some interview right so what we want to do is we want to ask for the review and give the system by which they can give you the review with out needing an account I caught a revue capture page to want to send him to a page where they can submit their name their email address how many stars are going to give you based on their sentiment five being the best and one <Music/Noise> level of satisfaction and a place where they can submit a tech space testimonial and then underneath that we want consent so they're giving you consent to use that reviewing your marketing and then a cement bond that's the anatomy of a killer effective review capture page and the beautiful thing about that is if they don't require an account you can get a much higher conversion of fun since the beginning five ten percent you can get twenty twenty five thirty forty percent plus and I and then on the Thank You page that's where we asked them to copy and paste on these different review sites unless it's negative it is a negative review we're going to do damage control we're going to quarantine at work in a firewall that thing so that the negativity that negativity doesn't spew on the web tarnishing the reputation online instead we get feedback from the client on how to improve but it's not spewing onto the web it's not spewing on to Google or Yelp or any of these review sites so it's quarantined is kept private and if it's positive that's where we ask them to share with the world and shared on these review sites like Amazon like Google like Yelp and any review site the strategic to your business doesn't make sense it makes sense for me and I can have a question about the wording so flashy that absolutely I think we can go about this kind of asking everybody that speaking kind of highly about its product or service or community for review that's a good tactic for sharing with that process that you just talked about the one that I didn't know is having a couple times that out as somebody uh thanks for your kind words of this is all the feet and runs great and <Music/Noise> it and then they would go ahead <Music/Noise> like a four or five star sia four or three star review <Music/Noise> like Oh it's was really good I like it but you know <Music/Noise> fallen yet because they're just like we can or you know maybe they just think it's worth four stars whatever so that really hurts we <Music/Noise> that four star believe it or not a lot of people don't even recognize it that really hurt and you're really going for that just as all filled out fight to get that glance at only one that fits ours only half filled and which is now the field right now that's as a little bit of a red flag for duty for that will there's a <Music/Noise> is not all the way to five like he was <Music/Noise> Five ghosts are so this is now what I do door and I would love your feedback on this I know actually when ness is these people actually say if you think is deserving of five stars would you take a minute to go in to rate <Music/Noise> the fields <Music/Noise> Here's the link some kind of precursor by saying hey if you think is earning a five stars so me very clear if they think is deserving then take the step where your thoughts on that I think it's a good step to take if you're sending them directly to one place like Amazon because then your pre screening numb and you're set you're planting the seed that you're expecting and wanting five stars so it's a conditional ask right so that makes sense in that case however if your rest restaurant for example hypothetically speaking and you're wanting more reviews for your restaurant you might hand out a little card with every bill passed by your servers this is how did we do please review us and get a chance to win acts like a hundred dollar gift certificate or some like that and then they go to your review capture page and instead assume them to Google or TripAdvisor or Yelp you're just getting the review first if it's negative who cares it's quarantined anyways and so now you have that feedback so it allows the system to give you transparency <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> your team is actually doing so instead of just getting people to blow hot air up your butt every day and just get positive feedback all day long why not get constructive feedback that's less than affirming but allows you to improve your policies procedures protocol and you know it's no skin off your back because its quarantine is kept private is just for internal use and then if it's positive instead of just pigeon holing them to one platform that they may <Music/Noise> have an account for we want to give them multiple options give them a menu Google Yelp TripAdvisor et-cetera Facebook and then they'll choose the one they have an account for him because given the multiple options are more likely to do something as opposed to nothing makes sense fire Nation that makes a lot of sense and healing Dorn has been dropping in value <Music/Noise> thus far this week we get back from taking our sponsors building establishing <Music/Noise> not easy if you know I design person that can be frustrating time consuming and extremely expensive to get great design work done that's why <Music/Noise> design crowd rather than paying expensive fees waiting weeks for a seat a patient ID or create a great looking logo for you you could

to learn more visit the Freedom <Music/Noise> dock on the door back and use these words a few times quarantined fire wall that you kind of brush the surface of how to best him in the reviews blissfully dive deep now how do we handle negative reviews the best possible way it's a great question and there's a study done where they found that seven out of ten consumers or customers will return to a business if their complaint is resolved quickly swiftly are quickly sewed speed is the name of the game so what that means is if we can have a feedback system by which to learn about any complaints that come and and and be all over it like white on <Music/Noise> said in a SWAT team to rectify the situation ASAP it dramatically improves the chances that they will come back that they will patronize you in the future that they will send you referrals of friends and family members so speed is really the name of the game and that's why having a feedback loop that makes a transparent his sole mission critical and you want to be able to have that system notify you immediately by text and or email the moment any complaints come in and that's why the testimonial <Music/Noise> reasons why the testimonial and so powerful is because it does up for you and your not only abreast of any negative feedback but positive feedback and let's face it John when you have an avalanche of positive praise come into your inbox is pretty hard to have a bad day no need for Prozac that right that's a good day so that's why having feedback on the positive and negative is so important he can stay on top of things you can affirm people when they're doing well and you can correct things when things aren't working as well as you'd like so is willing to get to good reviews <Music/Noise> as we get great reviews but then how do you actually use those reviews to get more referrals there is very loose terminology that can be interpreted different ways <Music/Noise> to refer all most people think of referral as a referral from a friend or referral from a colleague in that sort of thing you know one on one more serendipitous in nature and racially based based on people we know however now that we're in this digital age the referral idea can extend to these online review sites for example I have a client who gets two to four deals a month at three G's a pop in the mortgage business from Google every month because he's got oodles an oodles of rave reviews on his Google my business account people do online search and they see him come up in the three pack on the map right with that mouth with the with the flags he's right in there in the three pack the top three listings and he's got hands down way more reviews than any of his competitors so its clients calling him up saying hey we did our research we got awesome reputation great reviews we decided to hire you what's next pre cooked pre ten arise pre sold pre disposed to buy hot for what he's got there a slam dunk he gets four of those closed at least typically every month ok so that is a Google referrals far as I'm concerned but we don't stop there we also want to ask for referrals from our raving fans think about it who better to give us referrals and someone is give us a five star review I mean that's a raving fan right so what we want to do is launch a dedicated referral attraction campaign to our raving fans you've got a compilation of people giving you four or five stars by the way for stars aim by ad that makes five stars all the more believable I know perfection is hated because it's not five but it makes the fives more believable because it's like Superman <Music/Noise> wouldn't be as compelling enough trip tonight you get a little imperfection in there so nothing wrong with a four star so for stars above you compile lists those are called your raving fans right and now we launch a campaign and so for example you can send out a magic wand letter that's right we call it the magic one letter and it's got a toy magic wand and clothes in the headlines as I wish I wish poof get more clients like you know it's cheesy as hell but it works with more cheese in your wallet and the big idea there is that the client is awesome you should have other awesome clients just like them and perhaps they could miss make your wish come true by Cindy referrals I had a client who use that with his clients he said all fifty letters he generated six referrals he made eighteen G's in revenue cost him two hundred box Jose Ferraro why I like that are why I think this was the call positive I <Music/Noise> absolutely adore what <Music/Noise> is in today on fire so give us the partying at Pisa guidance you know how we can really take advantage of all of this awesomeness you know specifically what you're offering me how we can get a little test drive then the best league in disconnect with what you have going <Music/Noise> add them was taken by swill thanks again for me on one of the best ways for people to get the stuff and to help execute what we talked about today is to get systems that work while you're not working and so I put together a really cool package called the ultimate testimonial toolkit it's got checklists for getting testimonials and reviews in terms of what to do how to do it how to avoid mistakes it's got template swipe and employ proven template for asking for reviews for

nights yes full bless <Music/Noise> her is the founder and CEO of Wonder e aid network of storytellers one degrees podcast include sorta scale Hollywood in crime we study billionaires fall of Rome and their leaders hits I hate my boss before that Hurd was <Music/Noise> of Fox International channels a three billion dollar organization how do we get there after moving to the U S at twenty seven speaking broken English we're about to find out it's taken me to fill some gaps from that and shown give us a little glimpse of your personal life I'm here Los Angeles with my family took a It's spend a lot of time outdoors and alone time workin and one of the things that really got me excited about moving to the ass I grew up in Argentina and I had always looked out of the US some plays where you couldn't really get ahead by being the best in you can be whatever you are doing and he doesn't was and <Music/Noise> related to how many connections that who you <Music/Noise> went to school although of course these things matter and do matter but I always was attracted to this idea that in the US if you really dedicate yourself to what areas you want to do you can make it wow love that's love it's in her and what you say your area of expertise is just a couple sentences I be believer in reading people in the power of reading people getting to know them to indeed listening reading body language understanding people because that will help you in life and they'll help you in business I had a big moment when I was in my late twenties early thirties when I was working on FOX and a lot of people were coming to the petition please potential customers people I want to sell me stuff as I'm sure happens to you all the time and just how much time you spend with it the evil doubt will be a net positive versus negative in your life can have a huge influence on whether you make progress or you're always stuck in neutral and I think that's a lesson that any person especially entrepreneurs can take her in what is something that we don't <Music/Noise> reading people is on for years we probably should for instance there is a number of behavior said that the people that appear to be great on paper especially the people when you made them for the first time they're super exciting new find and other funny and they always have the right answer and they always make you laugh on their char Maine and then you start to scratch a little under the surface and you find that there's no there there most of us because of the primacy by as the primacy of eyes is just ugh you are me you can really remember the first impression that he get our sons were something or or somebody in our truck to the first version and it takes a long time to realize they may be that great person that we did for us is a bully or a used car salesman or antisocial and the negative energy that you spend getting rid of my razor she can bike the other hairs of your life so I'll recommend a look and there's actually a book that I read many years ago that talking about this whole emotional vampires that should be required reading for anybody starting a business or anybody quite frankly that he's still working for a company Fire Nation another area of her his expertise is storytelling he's a great storyteller and in fact this coming August at podcast them he's going be telling a pretty cool presentation giving a great presentation on storytelling in the dark I mean we're going to have the lights off his Jedi Knight masks he can really get the power of the story the power of audio so if you're in L A area in August me she gets a podcast whom I'll be there Kate of course since her knees maybe there was some other great people so deftly check it out now her and speak the stories I want to get into your journey as an entrepreneur <Music/Noise> of it with the Argentina thing but give us specifically what you consider your worst entrepreneurial <Music/Noise> during that <Music/Noise> and Hearn and leisure dive and take us to that moment in time tells the story remember only beat into butter for about a year and change has spent nineteen years on Fox being a corporate on Kubrick second I know that sounds horrible war I feel I was little where you could use a Youth Incorporated I was like oh you know I like the dream it'll be done for him for like nine out of the nineteen years I was there ten years I was relieved just fantasizing that want to be free on how my own business little do you know that we see when you have your own basis yes you get freedom in all respects but you never have complete freedom but I much rather be in for an error and ten thousand on the stone yet but the eye I think the worse moment that I had in my mind for dear life I nanny was an eye a big mistake or even not always see a fox so was making deals and going <Music/Noise> wall Daniel talking to people in tens of millions and hundreds of millions and we would spend twenty five grand before breakfast on the We will take out the teen for bonding all site and they'll be fifty grand so I come to podcasting it's only too happy and why do you give up TV for podcasts in and tell them you realize I actually gave up working for somebody else for Kramer Company podcast in the sun then deeply passionate about but after the ninety four for mines fine minds I'm not particularly patient person we got our first ever tie seen deal and he was twenty five thousand dollars and when I compare what you how much I would not be how long in time to go before I get excited with twenty five thousand dollars to what I was really excited by getting twenty five thousand dollars said alright well this is going to be a little more difficult than a guy thought and then the second deal the week I mean that we bring in his order to cease ten thousand dollars So at some point I'm really starting to question what is this a wise move I mean I could go into any other company to another version of what I was doing <Music/Noise> rough miles and then the bill money starts to kick in and and then before you know we were making six figure <Music/Noise> over have a million dollars a month in revenue by I gotta tell you that the moment where we got the second advertising the lead once more in the first one that to me Mom fell that we were going to fail I'm glad I I marched on that is one Dri have other <Music/Noise> beyond sponsorships we have licensing agreements so we'll trade show for the graphical locked Up abroad and we sold the rights to tune in A on all audio platform and after the other Susan we know we will release in more broadly now we want to make sure our <Music/Noise> gets what <Music/Noise> to make sure that we understand about the difficult and you had going from twenty five k which is always tough to get to the now is done it's handy like on <Music/Noise> direction we want to make sure our listeners gets from that story I think our listeners your leaders need to understand that progress is never lean year you think that you go from point A to B to say but sometimes you have to go in a different direction you have to take one step back in order to go one step for the only thing that you need to make sure that you do is that you take every sat by as a learning opportunity and make sure that you'd earned the right lessons from it Kingman jump around a little bit back to kind of my previous question on a follow up with the you have any other revenue streams are looking to open up the down the <Music/Noise> you just kind of focus on the sponsorships and licensing right now we are going to open up costs or revenue stream us well we'll we'll give our listeners the opportunity to directly contribute to the shows we haven't done that yet but some of our shows have been doing before the joint laundry and we are now going to do that for most of our shelves one odd moment her new name may be seen to be the mommy decided to open wondering or whatever that may be but take us to one of the greatest ideas you've had to date as an ox when you are and again really dive in and tell us that story that moment happened and how you turned it into a success I was trying to dig cold was so special of the serial podcast everybody had been listening to everyone <Music/Noise> to decipher the secret sauce behind it and one day Alice to work at Fox I flew back on a long flight and I mean just listen to for episodes one after the other gods soloing gross with a story so immersed in the story and there realize that when you listen to this to a story like cereal the more time you spend with the more emotionally invested your in the character's hand he'd hit me that television has been going through the same thing so low you have these procedural show so you can watch Juan and Ms three and and or sitcoms and then in two thousand one evil Laos people really gives people the ability to watch TV shows on their own time in a sequence from beginning to end and that's the you know you how The Sopranos on the wire and Game of Thrones on Breaking Bad so these so called Golden Age of Television was born change in technology the same things happening park I seem to think about the history off already alright that the Off Off talk all you non musical audio Howard Stern el V's any DJ any talk radio personality was grading their shows to grace a soul thinking that people may not be able to join a ten minutes or twenty or thirty and then leave out any one time so that the commercial that they make a tasty sign for the listening experience to show that you make Joan requires people to listen with attention from beginning to end the Serie A last holler in crime so the humble man was of this change in technology justly have been in television is going to change not only the way people listen to audio by the kind of ordeal shows are made and I want to be the forefront of creating those kind of all the shows and their local town council wisely and that somehow wonder he was born so cool I just love Fire Nation what happens when he was a step back and think that something that was so few of us do in this world enough you know we just go from activity to activity were O P A other people's agendas all day long what hurt India he said You know what sucks is going on with cereal he got a plane was in the four episodes he just thought like he does let the wheels span he figured out what was special about that you can do that in your industry in your passions fire nations give yourself the chance to do just that now her and give us the one take away the you want to make sure our listeners gets from that greatest idea you had today you always need to look back in history recent history all history and he always going to find one paralleled us for a line and that parallel ones you find in will give you the opportunity to be to be an industry the early stage of the vote only for too many people coming in before it's too late her new <Music/Noise> of exciting things going on a lot <Music/Noise> that are doing <Music/Noise> well and has a ton in the pipeline <Music/Noise> pretty cool what do you know just fired up about right now what do you think his name one thing what are you excited about this show which is logical I hate my body I think you're going to interview the <Music/Noise> couple weeks is so fascinating because you know if you ever listen to Love Line or the insurer or Dave Ramsey's older so many of my shows about relationships and money and real estate even there's never been a big shawl outdoor play and yet we spend so much time where we spent eight hours that year people total on my work wife for people to my best work friends by you you never know where we are prone to somebody at war and you don't know which will ask for advice because again as other people in the office because they may have a stake in the matter and he can ask your loved ones because they really know they're running the trains with you so we created these concepts in where the stone whose former Seymour used were with me and on Fox before that she was a Nike and she's a podcast or herself an author Larry See Lek an executive coach who asked either from Google and easy and small startups and as if they mean and they take the listener questions and the The show includes a comedy

most inspiring art you are safe and easy week and if you are ready to mash up for it to be disciplined in focus in one hundred days you must visit the mastery Journal dot com Now show today's featured guest Kathleen liquor s Kathleen are you prepared to eat bites absolutely let's do that Kathleen has held the thousands of health and fitness professionals around the world transform their business out of Orwell and generate <Music/Noise> for customizable coaching programs are used by health coaches fitness trainers and other wellness professionals to empower them to change lies on a global scale Kathleen take a minute to fill some gaps from that and shown give us a little glimpse your personal life that's how I live in San Diego with my husband and cats I have two teenagers though they do keep me pretty busy that about four years ago I became certified as a health coach and I sort of fumbled my way through things the bed with out trying to figure out the most efficient way to see clients and run my business and one of my main goals was always to have a schedule with a total flexibility because I wanted to be all my kids' events and school activities so I structured my business around that but when I started out I knew very little bike next to nothing really about on line marketing size as I was working to grow my business I was taking courses reading books The Thing a podcast like yours Johnny and I work for the couple of business coaches so I could make progress faster and avoid as many mistakes as possible so and you know when I look back I realize that it's pretty amazing how much you can learn to implement for years but at the time a kind of feels like you're going at snail's pace that's one thing I think he was a little big struggle with Kathleen is they don't really understand that slate age concept of the compound of fact where they get into the little things right everyday I mean that's the truth in business thus the truth in fitness test of truth in nutrition to wake up tomorrow be like Oh my God I look so great of a six pack in my skin is glowing you wake up a look at the mere six months later at doing the right things every single day so jus realise Fire Nation to the right things be accountable to that changes will occur now Kathleen what is your area of expertise just break down a couple sentences I tell my area of expertise is creating white label copyright free coaching programs the health and most professionals can use to help them feel more confidence and help their clients get great results so basically I do for them when they would do for themselves if they have the time in the experience and the knowledge which they probably don't have an Intel and the funny thing as I didn't find this area of expertise until I was almost fifty years old so it's never too late to start something new especially as an entrepreneur you know I always say that I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up and tell him not to listen sometimes you're going to take that long to figure out fine as you need experience you need time uni failures into successes to make things happen now within that area of expertise Kathleen and I love how you put that I was very clear very concise what is something that we don't know is on from yours that we probably should add I think part for any entrepreneur that wants to build a business is setting themselves up for success by choosing the tools and systems that they feel comfortable using in their business because feeling overwhelmed is a huge stumbling block to getting yourself out there and making prayer a sale I really think the key is to start simple like all caps simple Don't compare yourself to people that have been at this for years you know like people I have a like a five part video series for a lead nagged that they're running Evergreen webinars that got this intricate membership site things like that and I think if you are a health coach or fitness professional or any type of coach to really start with working with one and one people then move to adding something like an online program if if that's what you want to deal or if your brand you to creating elite magnet to carry or email lets start with something like a simple two to three page guide or like a cheat sheet in a don't don't over complicate things just because you see other people doing it doesn't mean you have to do it too and I'll share one perfect example of this that happened to me and this is how all this is how I know this cake and we all are from our mistakes right after I had worked with a few one on one coaching clients I launched an on line group coaching program and I didn't start out simple I thought they needed a little this uber cool learning management system and it took a lot of time energy to get them into place and guess what and the members Fayyad they would really just prefer to receive the content via e mail rather than having to lock into a membership site and I was like Really so that was a huge major lightbulb moment like I was the one that was hung up on the bells and whistles and not the people there are paying me for the program so I know it's it's too easy to go down the attack black hole in and have never lined team because there's too many dang options right and it can be confusing say you stay stuck and you don't do anything though im a time you can just launch a program with something as simple as e mail and then using Dropbox Google docs or Amazon s three and a face the group in an Iran as a beta group test things and then add more later sell I think is Keep It Simple say you can get started in by the way if a nation I'm even go one step further say that's how you'd need it to launch because that's what you <Music/Noise> what your clients or customers want until you have clients and customers will launch the minimally viable product this are having those one on one conversations get the feedback and then added integrate as you go and guess what they feel they're part of building this course is Cami the year creating they'll love that so Kathleen you haven't always had this much value to drop the oven always been a genius in these areas take us back to a time where you really struggled and specifically your worst off for a moment I want to take us to that moment in time and tell us that story are eight fell my biggest mistake with my business was doing everything myself and I had heard of burnout that I didn't think it happened to me I thought I was invincible and I was very very wrong the good news is that my business grew pretty quick lead but the bad news is that I didn't know how to delegate or really even who I could delegate to I was working hours each week wearing and too many half and try and juggle it all after I was about two years and I hit a wall I was exhausted stressed out completely worn out I had no energy I can focus on any new projects and I you know I hate to admit that they think a lot of people entirely I wasn't taking care of myself no way a bath i knew i shed and I know better you're finished or I shall slap on the rest so I took a couple weeks off to take a step back and chill and I just really take a look at what I was doing wrong then put the pieces into place to start delegating more things sell I'm a list of all the things I was doing the things that I coalition him again and do my own graphics Facebook ads social media <Music/Noise> writing my own email sales pages like crazy like when I think about it I broke down that list of the things they didn't enjoy doing or new okay maybe I like killing him but clearly my time could be spent better elsewhere like and can stuff I think if I was going to continue to build the business things we have to change and I was immediately start delegating and outsourcing and that's what a dead end at first it felt kind of scary that delegating led to actually making a lot more money and reducing my stress because I can focus on fewer things and you than batter and enjoy the process more without feeling like I was being pulled in a million different directions he's taken a couple sentences like it was an example of some of the delegated or to Liu's <Music/Noise> this will help you in your life if I knew she could maybe apply to their businesses pretty quickly it was more delegating to people so I found a graphic designer to do my graphics I found a great person to do my Facebook ads so for me personally it was more finding people that could do what I was doing and they could do better by the way for a nation lead EU what to do a bunch of things like okay like decently because this is going to happen where <Music/Noise> hazard you want to just invest in your business and bring on creepy five hats guy I've I've I have a graphic designer <Music/Noise> developer Ivan Amazon personally that just does my Amazon stuff you know that's why we're doing twenty thirty thousand dollars a month at Amazon I could be tinkering around <Music/Noise> swaddle I have critical time the BBB can a couple thousand dollars But no lets twenty x that's Vince you know what I'm paying a contractor to focus on this those pennies to That's return on that investment so think about your business in that manner now Kathy those Aussie an ah ha moments was delegating be people on your team or just kind of hiring out things you shouldn't be doing what's one of the other great ideas you've had tickets to that moment in time the you had this great aha moment in the walk as to how you turned it into success I know it's so funny that we don't feed all these things in one or an air brake on one am <Music/Noise> a big aha moments came as a result of what people were asking for Dad I didn't even think out of for example I offer a few different kinds of programs for my clients like a six month health coaching program at thirty jumpstart starred in some others and I was adding more programs people asked me Hey if I buy them all can I get a discount and I thought Oh my gosh that is brilliant why didn't I think about that cell based on what my audience wanted I packaged five of the programs that I had into a bundle and then when they purchased them bundled they would save one hundred and fifty dollars so it made it are real no brainer when they were at the checkout to feel happy that by these programs separately or I can buy this bundle and heck it's going to save me money so go and buy that soon and that has been a huge seller for me and I honestly don't think I would've ever thought I'd do if people massed sell big lesson number two as listen to your audience is asking for and find a way to make it happen if you can doing that one super simple Fein has had a dramatic impact on my revenue and yeah I wouldn't even talk to native people have asked me about it says Brady down now is one incentive to make sure our listeners gets from that great idea not listen to what your audience is asking Michael when they're e mailing <Music/Noise> you what are the most common question that you're getting and see if that something you can either add here per gram package it differently or offer something they'll be with the most fired up about right now like what gets you jumping out of the bed in the morning Arif this is thanks in part teal I am super excited about

you are really just felt out of wondering are they even want to have to offer and how might that the pieces and the place from attack and logistic standpoint and I really I did that one day the time and found the people that knew more than I did about the things I either need to learn or didn't want to do myself that deftly just that the element of self doubt was the best advice you have ever received it doesn't have to be perfect just do it if it's County's air quotes or if it's good enough you're ready to roll now I still have free myself of this on a regular basis but it's really help me move forward much more quickly instead of getting hung up on every single little detail and things being perfect was a personal habit that contributes to your success I have to say one of the most important habits that help me is writing down my goals and keeping a weekly To Do lists so I stay focused and I've tried out for this but I'm really a pen and paper kind of gal so that works for me I just use our weekly paper planner and check the check things off with a goal if I don't rate my things down they need you for the week I feel scattered and I don't get as much done because I lose track of what a filthy focusing on like for mapping out projects like major projects will use try lower ever known that from a daily to do's and reminders <Music/Noise> these paper your <Music/Noise> like ever notes with Fire Nation was use all the time is Graham early if the grammar and spelling checker and I use it mostly for my blog posts and emails super handy level of a few recommend just one

business model in her <Music/Noise> is helping our viewers have breakthroughs and paradigm shifts around creating more wealth and success in their business in life to take a minute fill the gaps from that in Sean give us a little glimpse of your personal life gosh really want to start with a past life that's out there that that kind of fun and so I live in Scottsdale Arizona married happily married for almost twenty two yeas three furry four legged friends to dogs and cats and two children William and Olivia who are twenty one and sixteen so they're a lot of my Y as to why I do what I do lose <Music/Noise> but what I would love to know is the What's of you do right now because that's were moving into right <Music/Noise> the personal because that kind of gives the flavor is going to get into the area of expertise he says you a name like what is that Vanessa my area fact that he's on the seas built from the inside out and very quick set of history he is that I found myself almost going bankrupt a few years into business and when I think almost bankrupt they talking about eighteen hundred dollars away from bankruptcy and that the irony though is at the time I actually had a six figure deal it was a lesson almost like a two hundred thousand dollar contract I was doing really well thus far the outside world was concerned and yet here I was to sabotaging behind the scenes and so my area of expertise has been built from gritty my <Music/Noise> around that time and learning to having to build a business from the ground up but also having to understand empower Lal what the shifts past me that need to take place what's that in a game work and particularly in a game walk around being more successful and receiving and handling more wealth in one's life so kind of empowered when I'm helping people build their business but I feel if we know having that conversation as well when missing out a massive chunk of learning good dive into the word intervene were going to get green <Music/Noise> what is something that <Music/Noise> our viewers just don't know these fine over and over again when it comes in a game like that where missing that we probably should now ask a question I mean one of the things I often feel like entrepreneurs say for example is nothing's gonna stop me I'm so gung ho I am ready to go I'm not mistaken all the rest and feel less like these names that that that the times that it does <Music/Noise> and again we see that on social media so you know you could have an awful lot of courage to actually say at Family First add anxiety coming up or matching not soul about you know really where I'm going here and so I do feel that they can be quite a lot of denial as to the set of emotional experience of you know the entrepreneurial journey and that's really what I mean by the end again it's you know how does it feel like what are some of the emotions that we go through I call it the emotional roller coaster one day that's something that's really big and exciting enough but Unit C and as a new client that we sign up and then the next day we have a climb backing out or the sudden it feels like crickets every single endeavor that we going through said can feel like emotionally well up and down the whole time to be really careful about how we how that affects all decision making process in business too if we make decisions from that sketch more anxious place they can and very different to making them from that excited place and in fact one of the things I'm still teaching my entrepreneurs is not to be made to panic or excitement but how about we go to more grounded centered place and make decisions from that and I think that that grounded and centered ness is something that's not talked about enough pasta pasta because it sounds sexy enough yet it's very powerful is super powerful if you're going for the marathon violation of UN to be around not just tomorrow not just next month next year five years from now going to be because the ground is because you <Music/Noise> putting one foot in front of the other in taking care of the balance of your life slide at the flea love that ideal in essence I mean I deftly subscribe to know you did kind of briefly mention a struggling time that you went through and I don't wanna talk about when you're struggling times actually want to dive deep into what you consider your worst arterial moments today so an asset don't plan to share a love that band aid take us to that moment that I kind of get that story of meeting bankrupt if I was preparing for this I realize that that wasn't the toughest moment and that the toughest moment she came pretty recently Flight be on the same time I thought you wanted to share that because we'll have the stories of being way in the past and a ten years on and it's all different I thought No to show one that's really authentic and that small presents so I host live events as part of our business model we host an event called the big bold event that takes place at the end of the year and last year's event which was our third year running we was six weeks prior to the event going live in six weeks if you know anything about the event model is crunch time to close contracts are in place financially I am seriously commited Idol lot of financial responsibility at that point and this is a lot of risk taking involved and sponsors on board and promises that are being made and I got a phonecall from a mate done major hotel chain that was am hosting the events to tell me they would no longer be hosting it and I can honestly tell you it really was one of those moments when I thought I was going to pass out I mean I just couldn't believe that I was hearing this I kind of reconsider his temporary shock as in everything was prepared and ready to go this was once an Aria that I had never ever advocate stopped to consider could happen and with that not only were they so this is the most of the wrong person you know what the contract what you speaking to the other people that you've double booked with and clearly they had a much better off on the table presumably by much bigger business and they decided no they were they were going to go into full breach of contract on me as a small business owner and not only that it was a holiday week at our event was taking place on the holiday weekend on a crucial school weekend and it meant that the whole city was already full so they'd already for me to say not only were they cancelling but I had already phoned around their part the hotel to see who could help me and basically the news was nobody could it really was a mess I'd love to say Tony said wow there were quite the same thing and that she does kind of the interesting part of the I mean obviously I'm in a few practical things that happened I had to process the information incredibly quickly and then immediately call Milan as well to say hey what can be done this of course call in help but what's really interesting is I think we often look at these tough times and we expect that to be this very elegant in sight and something that looks very pretty and something we can be proud to live on this if somebody being see me behind the scenes and behind the scenes then i was like a Tigris you know fighting to protect my turf and was really interesting is it just kicked in this kind of inner edge of how the day you you know I have really done everything by the had my facts out of this contract I would have been liable for tens and tens of thousands of dollars and as a small business owner yet I have to be in integrity with my commitments and I taken very seriously yet he you all missed a big hotel chain or misses big hotels on this day is in fact make that happen to be guys that are listening it just happens to him and that today but the message and then you know and hey you on this kind of thing has the potential to actually put me out of business itself and so was interesting is it sort of kicked in not in a U S The question the beginning ignite the fire that was that was lit inside of me six weeks before that event was also you you just watch you needn't think that this is going to stop me and Zan and not only that you know I'm going to take a stand teh for small businesses and role model what it looks like to have fair compensation and really you know hold you to keeping up your end of the deal here so the long and the source of it was I mean we had to rally as a very small scene with a very small amount of time and relocate to another city which actually ended up being in awe to our advantage that was like the the major gifts and winds up being a much better property and hotel that had breached the contract had to pay the difference so who is a gift and we ended up with our most successful event today so there were a lot of gifts on the other sucking up on the other side of it but it was sort of the If it for me it was more interesting to really see my own process of how I approached it cheering that sort of fights and to you know to come up against you know basically something that's threatening my business and my community see and realize that you know hey I'm really really serious and committed to what we're doing here and I'm not going to be stopped so we just have to know we will make a workaround furnishing your back is against the wall when you <Music/Noise> other choice but to survive you survive and that's why we're still around here you know sixty thousand <Music/Noise> the humans are survivors we survive you know I love saying that baby effect kicks in is one of those things where you know Yeah I get are scared to make that phone call or knock on someone's door you're scared to do what I get is nerve wracking but guess what when you have that baby of the child in all so new looking your baby's eyes you're more scared of not providing food shelter to that big when you are making that little silly outbound phone call things get put into perspective in that fire comes up and you make the most of it now that so well getting and in really any detail just real quickly what exactly did you do to get the conversation that you needed from this hotel back and was anything additionally had to do as well was it just make up that difference the ad that was a lot because at that point to say I've really taken a stand for my community and that you know we we say that we provide high end service and cultural community say he was a place I was I really had to demonstrate that so I went way above and beyond the contract to mean that was certain things contract that contract when that's the big lessons really makes a great legal advice because our contract was solid super sell it for the things that they just couldn't get out of but then it really went into the whole inconvenience the We are very very small team with limited resources and we are now stretched to mamak for the time when you know we should be marketing this event and just making sure that they had to do the right thing by our clients that were flying into another town our clients that were attending that event because it was in their local town now they had to be relocated so we were able to surprise some of those attendees with Hailey yes yes with changing the venue and it's actually been a better venue but by the way you're getting three nights you know in this gorgeous room plus we've arranged for you to have like a hundred dollars a day to take care of your additional like Simon Says and by the way if you need transportation which is a two hour journey that can be thrown in as well so we sort of we know we were able to go you know really go above and beyond for them for those clients that wing convenience to find his nicest in the uni to me you know the you doing right by York lies The you've been wrong step up take a stand and do what's right now Vanessa have to be much more concise with this story but I still want you to tell it just in a much smaller shorter man or one of your greatest ideas give us one of your aha moment you've had in your <Music/Noise> an entrepreneur ok and this sounds really trite it came it became quite a few years ago but it was the whole idea of building a business around ideal clients and now it sounds very simplistic when I say something that we teach but at the time and it had never dawned on me that we could really craft a profile of ideal clients and look at who we can do our best best work with and who would really pay off handsomely and market to them and fill our business with ideal clients which she called him champagne clients not in mine as the sole key lesson that we talk about here for podcasting where Cushing people with podcasts

"8","Smart Passive Income Podcast","268_How_to_Up_Your_Online_and_Offline_Game_with_Jordan_Harbinger.mp3","this is a smart having a podcast with Pat Flynn such a Number two hundred and sixty anyway the Welcome <Music/Noise> passive Income podcast where it's all about working hours no so you can sit back and reap the benefits later the Note <Music/Noise> he's the founder and president of the four AM globe pad place by everybody thank you so much for joining me today in this session of the Smart has become podcast really excited because we're bringing back guess who's been on the show before and he's one of my favorite people as of late because he's the host of one of the only podcasts I listen to actually only subscribed in religiously listen to two different shows at this point I'm first one is the model Health Show with Jon Stephenson who's also been a guest on the show before but that's not who were who were interviewing today we are interviewing Jordan harbinger the host of the art of charm podcast and the reason why I only listen to two shows I mean to go back in time I remember subscribing to over thirty different podcast episodes which was awesome because I could get and consume all that content in a very short time period however I realized that the more I listened to podcast episodes the last I was actually doing to implement those things so I didn't and one I've implemented what I learned from jammy France and from Internet Business mastery it's a concept called just in time learning and that is I only allow myself to consume information and learn about things related to the next task that I'm doing this really helped with cutting out all the things that aren't necessary right now now that doesn't mean I just ignore everything else except for what's next on my list but I put those things aside I put them into an ever Note folder so I have all these different folders with topics ranging from pay interest to Facebook advertising to technology things that I find that are interesting that I just don't need right now but when it's time when it's time for me to start learning about pay interest I have all that information readily available for me is just now's not the right time now the model shows a show I listen to consistently because I'm always focused on my health and then the art of charm is one a listen to because it's focused on personal development in a number of different ways from business to <Music/Noise> at home to just having energy in your life and and having great interactions with people which obviously affects your entire life and so that's those are two shows that I listen to even know they're not necessarily exactly related to the next thing that I'm working on they are related to just everything that I'm doing all the time so health of course important effects all my business and then of course learning to communicate and interacting with people that's what the art of charm helps and serves me for and I can say listen to and so very happy to welcome back Jordan harbinger from the art of Turnpike as you can find him look up the art of time on I tunes or look up or go to the art of charm dot com Well about Jordan he's first of all great storytelling teller you'll hear that he's also a great communicator he feel like I feel like it is exactly what to say in this is obviously something he's great at so great that he teaches and he does workshops in those kinds of things to help people become better versions of themselves and who they are who they represent and that's why I wanted to bring him on to talk more about essentially upping our game for business for life or communication with relationships and so all the things we're going to talk about related to how to be a better host on your show if you have a podcast or video channel had to be a better speaker and things like along with that to you how to walk into a room and have people just immediately have a good vibe with the like all these kinds of things <Music/Noise> useful especially if you start going to conferences and things like that start interacting with people in person but even if it's done online stuffs can be really helpful so let's just dive right in this is Jordan harbinger from the art of charm podcast to go with the chasm so happy to welcome back Jordan harbinger from the art of charm podcast website and program in all things amazing related to Jordan thanks again for coming back on the show today this is always fun and I have great history no we've not only have interviewed you've interviewed me but no I feel like we have a good vibe we can relate to each other were a lot were very similar with where we're in business in separate trading spots nine teens and staff what's what's been happening in your life recently like what what what's got you excited before we get some of the meaty content of the show sure so we hit three million downloads for the month of February which was super exciting that's more to me and that you never know man you our trading we were literally like a ninety eight ninety nine in iTunes for months and months and months and months I just got sick of looking at us like neck and neck the whole time will tell me what you did like how can I come back to your level Malik what did you do what did you do anything that actually really enhanced where your podcast was at yeah you know there are there are few things I did that I thought were for sure going to work and didn't do squat or maybe did a little and there are other things that I did kind of for the love of the game turned out to be some of the best things I could've done so for example all these little tricky things I used to ask every person who email Dan and we're talking hundreds of people per day his desk all of them to review the shell ice as all who share the show I posted every episode on social media I engaged with everybody on those and I engaged in discussions on those and I put them on Reddit and into all of that contributed to very little I mean got a ton of iTunes reviews don't get me wrong but it didn't really get us into more people's brains in more people's ears the things that actually made the difference for me was after a while I was on NPR and there was a journalist was interviewing me and she had seen me speak and vent about hacking thing that I had done a talk given about this social engineering thing that I had done and I soccer note that in her journal Island hey do you mind walking me through your notes and she had these great notes on my talk and she had notes on the talk that she and I had very briefly after my talk which is like ten maybe ten or so seconds long longer than we talked just based on a few things I'd said to her and other reporters at this event and then we had a phone call she a great notes on that and then she had googled me and found all these different sources and get great notes on that and I went only us this is how professionals prepare for show and this is a few years ago and I started to go hi I'm clearly lacks because she did a great job intervene and I was like out now I know you work for NPR you really get this Zune marketplace that show on American Public Media and so then I started instead of just having people on my show which I used to just do the essays to have someone on the show I would have read their website maybe this new couple episodes of their stuff they had one or looked at some of their tweets and social media and I would interview them and have a conversation that's how I did the Art of Chun podcast for six plus years and after that point we just passed our tenth birthday after that point after the six birthday or sell give or take I started to really kick things into high gear because the TPM marketplace interview and I started to read the book that the person had written in its entirety I would read the thank you Paige and I reach out to some of the acknowledgment people try to get anecdotes I would look at the Amazon reviews I would read the different sources online from this person I would listen to interviews of them done by other people which is great no Israelis decent enough snow to my little mind not agree to use at some level but those he is now create those notes and then I would go over those notes the day before the shell in right questions about my own notes in my notes and so that became the structure of the interview and so I went from mildly entertaining conversationalist to possibly the most comprehensive interviewer that most of the guests on the show have ever actually spoken with outside of their particular nice so if I'm interviewing say Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs who is just on the show recently I will watch dozens of episodes of that I will read everything the guys written on social media and online journal read dozens of entries about him online and that that level of preparation even though a lot of it is redundant really resulted in me knowing this person's content almost as well as they did and so I started to kind of go for it with some of these guests and scientists and I know I've done a decent job within any given interview if a neuroscientist or behavioral economist or something like that if I ask the question they go ah good question nobody's ever asked me that if I know the answer but I think it would probably be THIS THIS THIS and THIS or great question I don't think anybody's ever caught that you clearly read the book those are the kind of things that you want going for you because what it means is you're dragging them out of their auto pilot mode in terms of giving their sound bites during an interview and you're making them think and very very very few show hosts do that if for making the guests think you're making the audience think and for people to listen to the art charm they're not just listening because of corny jokes or something like that they actually want to think they want to learn same with your audience making them think they they go Ah this is a good use of my time not yet another show with a bunch of crap o la not that I don't care about you really want to challenge them to guests and the audience and that resulted in a lot of people sharing because when people learn a lot when they're challenged they can confidently say you need to listen to the show you need to listen to the show not just Hank I have this one on my podcast and subtle and kind of funny they know that they can confidently share it because you're not going to disappoint the person they're sharing it with so it doesn't cost them any social capital to recommend you write they're not going to it's not like we recommend a restaurant a person goes and goes Yeah I got sick from that place you go oh and then you may think I can never listen to Pat again he's got terrible restaurant recommendations right they actually gain favor they gain social capital by recommending art of charm because the person does wow that was definitely worth it what else what else we have in mind or they want to talk about the content with their friend so stepping up the craft of interviewing the preparation made a huge difference in the quality of the show which actually resulted in a lot more sharing which actually surprised me yeah that's really interesting so you're almost creating the show's cool for people to gain social capital and when you take that approach you have to make it great or else people are going to share it all and end my question to you relate to that and I told you earlier when knows where this interview is going to go last and we had Jordan on the show we're going to talk about the whole business plan of our charm and we even discuss the AL and lean over to get into that day but I like with this going right now which a would be worse whatever letter we're at right now is also another sign of a good interviewer a kind just take things where you want them to go based on what you guys have at that time and we're wondering now is ask you if you take that level of preparation how do you make sure you still connect with your audience because I've listened to podcast before where it's obvious that the person did their research but when they are asking questions when they're having a conversation I'm like I feel left out as a listener like ie skipped over but stuff like how it like how you make sure you bring your audience with you to leave them behind yeah this is really an important question because I think for us a lot of times it's a really easy for us as hosts to be so into let's say Smart passive Income strategies are on line business it's really easy for us to lose the audience any kind of have to remember that every single episode you create it someone's first time hearing you so you gotta make sure that what you're talking about is applicable to everyone regardless of whether or not they've heard your show before and you've also got to make damn sure that your knots what does that sort of term for when you're talking in a jargon the bottle and nobody understands it group rights not group think but it's basically when you and I are talking in such jargon decoded esoteric language that people who are at our level will understand that's a great way to alienate your audience and I've switched off many a podcast about business when they start talking and that way I've switched off many shows for every reason when they start really getting into details that are would take me too much time to go back and think about so you have to not only think like a beginner when your host but you also have to keep the advanced folks entertained and that's a very tough balance is a hosted to do in real time and I think it's very crucial to make sure that you can do that so the best hosts around they're able to take complicated topics like what you take in make it really relate able instead of highly technical and intimidating and that takes in my opinion takes years of practice it does him absolutely does and I'm still improving myself and I'm sure you know that there are ways that you can improve as well if you were the comments on your own podcast what would be one area that you wish you could improve upon well it's funny should mention that because I'm always working on some specific area of my presenting skills on the art of charm and you'd mentioned yeah when you're good host you just take things where you want to go based on the vibe you're getting and I went through going through different levels of competence when it comes to hosting for example so when I first started it was like ok prepare everything and write an outline of the show and present it and then after that was NO don't write an outline is too mechanical just have a conversation and then I kind of went back to actually you need to have a really good outline with a lot of details and you need to know that outline so well that you can have a conversation about it that sounds really laid back and it sounds like you're really well and form naturally but you've really put in a ton of work to it and sort of the next step for me is rounding out that vibe a little bit more so making it sound even more conversational even more laid back even our sort of just two guys hanging out or to a guy a girl hanging out talking about this is talking about that I mean we've had to head to CA on recently and we had General McChrystal on recently amid these are guys that live in a different world than me making that sound like I just sort of met them at a restaurant having a conversation that's the vibe I really want but I also want all of the background information and learning to be present there and to be able to deliver that vibe but also had that amount of background study and any given topic that's been very challenging and that's what I'm working on right now does it make sense yet as thank you for sharing that do you feel like everytime you go into an interview now you're confident it's going to agree or are their interviews that you go into where it says you're not getting that response that you want and if that's the case would you do at that point I actually have a lot of Yeah I go into every interview pretty much expecting it to be great and that's not just like what you visualize becomes reality I mean I expected to be great because the level of Pratt that's gone into it and the I'm not afraid to kill my darlings is our friend Michael Port likes to say what I mean it's his wife and most he says in a report the real what that means the show biz term and what that means is you might create something and it's amazing <Music/Noise> and you think it's awesome and it just doesn't fit in it doesn't make it in the final product and you can't really lean on your sunk cost and this works in business and works in writing it works and podcasting it works and everything and what I mean by that is I might read an entire book and go that was just fascinating I can't wait to talk to this guy and then I'll record the interview and then at the end my producer or me just goes yeah that was only okay and it's very tempting to go book but I read the whole book and we recorded the whole thing we have a picture and I flew to L A to record it and it's just like Do you want to put out something that didn't end up how it was supposed to or do you want to kill your darlings and basically respect the audience's time knowing that what you've created is not worth putting them through and that's been very tough and that's something that I had to learn the hard way a lot but now to answer your question there's so many things that going to show preparation and screening in gas did this and that me and meeting with my producer and all that stuff that by the time it gets to be the point where I'm jumping on Skype or meeting them in person that interview there's almost no chance can go wrong unless the person and that the cases when it does go wrong is when usually the person is like I'm sick today but I'm able to do it you're thinking on now or they'll pay the studio thing broke Simon a conference room in your dislike <Music/Noise> not going to go as well as his plan and and so there's always those sort of little x factors which is why real big time radio and TV studios those people control everything I ever been on a daytime TV show for example but if you have for those of people who have their hse there so weirdly at first I thought it was weird now it makes sense they're very good about control they're good about controlling the environment and I mean on the Today show and they're like Oh OK you're going to stay at this hotel and I thought I live in New York I don't really want to stay at hotel it doesn't make any sense and they go PM Please say the hotel and the carrots I gotta say though town like we're going to pick you up in the morning and I thought I can take the subway I have a metro card and five blocks away no we're going to pick you up in the morning and I thought alright fine so I got into town I get some sleep and I go up in the morning in his car there and a driver there any drives into the underground garage at the Today show <Music/Noise> we get out and there's a makeup person and hair person the clothing person and then after I did that I remember talking to our PR person this is when I was on Sirius XM satellite Radio talking with our PR person saying why did he do that it's just a waste of money and she goes No they want to know that you're not out drinking the night before because I realize we did meet with the producer at nine pm that was weird yeah this weird late meeting him in to talk about seemingly nothing and then when I got up there the driver was there and we got in the car so they knew it says that driver saw me he could call the executive producer of the associate producer and go gotta write they have in our flat they're not default drunk or hung over or inaction they're not freaking out there's nothing weird <Music/Noise> have a black guy there's nothing happening here that's going to be strange we going for hair and makeup were there so early I remember thinking we're just killing time here and the reason is because they want to make darn sure for a live show that there be no <Music/Noise> there controlling what you're doing get time to feed you and give you coffee and get to dress to be cufflinks and do your hair and make you shave again whatever it needs they require that level of control now we can't do that as podcast or is just yet however it really showed me the amount of thought and control that goes into creating a really good show whatever you think it's that time TV show does something similar and I get to me that was fascinating and it made me sort of my own game when it came to doing this show because people might think Oh yeah you know radio shows and podcasts he does have a conversation and great conversation no good hosts they make it work so easy because they're still practiced in there so versed in the content but truthfully they have worked ridiculously hard to make it look as easy as it is it's just like an athlete playing basketball or Tony Hawk who we had on the show skateboarding reason he looks like he can just sort of put one foot on that thing in cruisin do some nine twenties or whatever is because he's been doing it for decades but if you get on that skateboarding you try to do a flip our halfpipe you're going to the hospital face yeah yeah so the bed that is really fascinating actually a less excuse than a person I've never done that but I think I'd be very inspired by the production and how things are put together it almost makes me remember the recent viral video that is not enough you seen the start of a link to it in the show notes if in case people haven't seen it but I'm sure he probably had it was on the BBC some guy was doing an interview this guy was in his home is very professional interviews in his suit at his desk and then the door open behind them it's like his little toddler toddling in and the and in the one in the roller comes in <Music/Noise> comes or or somebody comes in is like riffs about other <Music/Noise> like is this hilarious and just makes me wonder if you've experienced anything like that in terms of OK unexpected things that happened during interviews or during recordings or something and kind of if you could if you have in mind like the walk is the in kind what happened from there oh yeah cash there's so many little things that go around it once I had a different audio desk right now got this nice wooden custom desk that I really love God all my interfaces in it but before had this big plastic roti case like a lot of people carry for audio gear once my cat got stuck in there in the middle of the shell and it's kind of a problem because there's wires in there and not only to the cat and plan something organic something but I don't know I mean they could get shocked I really don't know how all that gear is built and it's really hot in there so she got in there thinking oh it's nice and warm here and then only ask if he can get out and and so I had cat issues right had to stop and like surgically remove the cat from a woman of cables plug it back in and get back to it but there was another time where I was on the Jeff probe show is a host of Survivor and this is a daytime TV shows like being filmed as we did it and I sat on this couch and as I sat on the couch there are but there was however was the guest before me to sound awful but whoever was the guest before me was significantly overweight and I took their seat and at first I thought Wow this person really squished the cushion down it should recover soon maybe I'll slide over I didn't realize was there was clearly a board underneath this cheap studio couch there was a board that had come dislodged or metal pole or something that had gotten dislodged and bent so midway through one of my sentences you hear thump in my legs go up in the air and my butt sinks down like half a foot of ash are born with like sitting way back like a dentist's recliner chair and the middle of his daytime TV show and at the end of the day when they aired it Finally I mean when it was broadcasting it was going it was out there but I think in all subsequent re runs because when I look for the clip online it was kind of this abrupt cut where the beginning of my sentence sounds like a sentence fragment and immediately shift to the host saying something like Well that's certainly interesting in it's like what did that happen weapon there oh yeah that's when my feet went up three feet the air and I ended up having to put a pillow under me so that I could sit upright it was the most awkward thing ever because of course as soon as that happens you're under studio lights you turn red your makeup you feel like is running you don't want to keep touching your face because you're on camera and you're sweating you're sweating you're sweating a sliding and just trying to ignore this whole thing and realizing that I'm doing a terrible job of looking calm and collected trade all on national TV that was kind of fun and I realized at that point that no matter how much effort you put into something no matter how much kind of control you've got over the situation there's always going to be these wild card things that happen that you just can't do anything about like a guest sitting in your spot before you get there yeah so funny love it now you mentioned and our good friends Michael Niemi port to help a lot of people with public speaking in getting on stage and we sort of talked a little bit about the pie testing stage already or studio stage but what about the real life stage in terms of public speaking I know that the last time we spoke together that was something you were hoping to get more into it obviously sounds like that's going very well for you tell us about that journey was like to third shift from podcast stage to real life stage sure it's old switching from the podcast called a quote stage aka really hot room in my house that's probably going to be a kid's bedroom one day come that sound proofed which will also help when it gets really hot this weekend the stage thing was interesting the reason I picked it up was originally i thought oh you know this is great I mean to be in for more people it's not really the case your podcast is almost certainly going to be in front of more people than the few that fit into any given room however for me it was kind of like and I really that good and seeing in hosting a show I mean if I can't do on stage and I really that good at it and so I thought why not just get really good at speaking because we see people who are really good at speaking it somehow adds credibility to just every other area of their life and there was also something that just didn't make sense here I am hosting the art of charm about charisma personal magnetism networking relationship development it would look pretty weird if I got up on stage was like hello everybody and shaking and dripping sweat that wouldn't look too good it would look like I didn't walk the walk so I did hire Michael any port to whip me into major speaking shape created a keynote which I've given a lot of times and really big stages and I like you I felt like I just kind of was decent at it and it became really funny you give huge key notes you give really good ones it seems like you're also into speaking right I mean you can't not be in for hiring for gg and DeLorean has such a blast doing it something that reminds me of when I use to perform with the band them literally marching band not the rock band that was probably my dream back the day but even before you practice something you rehearsing it over and over and over again and then all this and it's time to go out and perform that's what I feel like when I'm onstage I get that rust I got back in the day and I sort of zone out when I'm onstage and just on autopilot because I've been practicing so much and then afterwards I'm just like back into reality and what has happened in ads I have this amazing high coming off a stage and plus the interactions that you have with people afterwards him to receive experiences while people come to peace in whatever job he did but not only that just how much they've learned from you and how much you've been able to affect their lives or what their decisions are going to be from that point forward it really is an amazing experience have I mean what do you feel being on stage and after it's all done I always am secretly relieved that its overall say that but I love the fact that I'm able speaking was also great for these reasons Al Ameen that's a great question I love the feeling I get when it's done I love the feeling of the visibility and the people coming up to talk to you and saying I really like it but you're you're right there's one thing that I missed that was one of the main reasons why learn how to speak which was when you go to an event and or a speaker not only do you get promo for the event from the marketing from everybody knowing who you are but when you go to an event and you want to talk to one of the speakers they're often really busy in other people's land and etc et-cetera But if you want to go to an event and talk to one of the speakers and you're another speaker they're often like Yeah let's go to dinner or speaker there at the VIP thing we say Hey mean some of the other speakers are going to go grab a beard you want to come with us and you're kind of in this other pool of people that are sort of pre screened and vetted and so he's really really busy speakers will often say Yes I want to go and hang out with the other speakers and so it's kind of it's kind of like an automatic ultra VIP ticket to every event you go to that is also free or even our ally positive in that some events will pay you to come and speak and take you to a speaker there and put you up every treat after the event with all of the other speakers in fact I'm going to an event in Australia called we are podcasting podcasting events and the event itself was really fun people are really cool who are in it but after that event there's a speaker retreats for days on the beach at a beach house and it's awesome and I went last year and am becoming really good friends with all these people staying in this house and you know grilling up veggies veggies and eating and going surfing and swimming and that's the kind of thing that you actually couldn't buy a ticket to that right Yeah it was an experience only available to the event organizers and some of the speakers at the event and that kind of access creates relationships which as you know from the entire point of the art charms that relationships are your strongest lever so being able to put myself in a position that created the super strong relationships and those levers was a no brainer even though it required learning how to speak facing my fears paying blood money to have Michael Port won the best guys in the world in a report train me how to do this and flying out to them to do it for it was a twenty day class I took with them spread out over four weeks in frickin Philadelphia I live in San Jose so it wasn't cheap in terms of time or money but it was but so worth it to to learn that skill set yeah me was that something you are planning for in terms of connecting to the speakers as you are starting to become a speaker is that a by product of it's actually something I was planning for which is why was the president mentioned earlier I was actually planning that because I thought Oh I'm going to speak at some events in a meet the other speakers I didn't think that some of the speakers would become so my closes friends I met Hughes began a van I think we may have known each other before but we definitely hung out at different events as speaker is I know was it an ex or something yet laid back day but that's when we met each other we got close and we've since stay connected with each other yeah yeah exactly"

number two hundred and sixty nine ext welcome to the Smart passive Income podcast where it's all about working hard now so you can sit back and reap the benefits later and now you're toast most of his closet consists of t shirts from startup companies had played by he would every happen here and thank you so much for joining me in a session of the semi passive income podcast super stoked to hear am really excited for this interview because it's a very unique one we are interviewing one of the four co founders of a company called charities and what is Chevy they sell <Music/Noise> shorts name might be thinking to yourself well how interesting can an interview from company but shorts can be well this has been one of the most inspiring and interesting and educational interviews I've done in a while because Tom over at Chez he's going to reveal exactly how they've been able to build this massive massive brand and most cult like following for their product and how they been able to use content to do that and how they empower their community and how is it now this company spreads like wildfire because of word of mouth and it's just really inspiring especially for me now that I'm creating a physical product very soon I think for anybody you want to create a sense of culture you want to create that kind of word of mouth recognition and and know that this is this is exactly what you need to listen to what's really cool also about this is is the meaning behind what they do and how they portray that and how they are like I said bringing this community to gather in a way that grows the brand which is again empowers the people who are actually the customer so we're going talk alot about that so let's not wait any further this is Tom from Shelby's comments to this guys had here with Tom from Shelby's chubby short stack on time thank you and welcome to the SBA I guess thanks for being here absolutely thank them so you and I actually is for semi spoken but I've heard about Chevy so many times from my good friend Matt who many of the listeners know who is my partner in a number of business is and who also his company's help you with your website design first of all when Matt first introduced chubby short stock Omni I was like ok retail store clothes okay whatever and I went to the site and I was immediately blown away from immediately answered To understand like the personality of Chevy is in the culture and then I went over to rinse around like holy crap three hundred thousand followers and you sell shorts like oh what's that like you found this amazing company with so much like such a great following a huge culture behind it like what what's what's it been like for you I mean it's amazing you know for us it's all about the community and thought about giving people a good time so that's the idea when it is that it is entirely about having pie and making jokes and that the building in short shorts company is so awesome that we have this community grow to love our product that we put out yeah it's very very very awesome work expresses how did you get started with his yeah so so <Music/Noise> there's there's four total co founders business I'm one of them and get started because we're all just good buddies and honestly we all wore short shorts and that and we'll have like different like legendary pairs of short shorts and that they were like that down combat uncle's house thousands in the store and everyone had a white marquee pair would wear again or whatever and just the walls to Abram and the other side of the sass in her study was just really label it with washboard abs alone covered shirtless guys are going to church in cargo shorts and that we relate with that kind of the products was was so obvious to us because we couldn't find anywhere we were just so passionate about it and down and the brands are that of all of that kind of that feeling of everything just a little too serious in the fashion and so does other work on what sort of content to be put out what sort of messaging and that and done and we made fifty pairs that the group decide on a whim that I sell and we went to the shores of Lake in California and and we had a plan to set up booths and we go from from groups on the beach like marketing people about the product and write about sports or bored I am asking to buy them having their rest in the same sorts with the smallest in class and the Erie held upright he launched the website and thirty thousand eleven and that's really when the marketing of the concert began and was immediately something where people where we are models that we that we were hired with Justice else reading or science like this pristine kind of dark that was really fun and we wrote our emails you are likely ready for that was really tan and that the Colonel was my day is like one of my friends and we want to expand their spending as much as we can't do that is what all of our finances are really the personality of the Grahams and and and that's with a rich man like me that's the way are adding more and more expensive this group of wealthy like the world and we meet somebody on the street of restaurants and lastly they are personality humor I could staff the one thing about Martin was involved in that building that community group that focuses on what we care about what we think that I can hear on your website and I scroll down and then I see what's on his mission statement or like hey this is this is who we are in big bold blue section where you can read and Skye has different divisions in the first thing I see here is what the Saudis here's what we what we believe we believe in the weekend and then a bunch of other ones and <Music/Noise> her Instagram as well it says hey the weekend has arrived so it was lots this weekend deal and why's that important yeah I'm impressed with the work week is encroaching more and more and more on the weekend and we can do something we need to protect and save or so we really do think about the slight battle that's being seen and the workweek and cell phone starting to creep up on more and more of our lives and connect whatever you do and we're fighting the fight of let's expand the times were having fun times are at with friends and family that's so important to us and guiding light behind everything that we do and that's that's that's when you're not stressed about your career or what you're doing next or how you can make the next you're taking time to enjoy life that's really what we do provide a service anyway that's what you are close to the content we wanted to be that kind of incidents of levity and weekend is that to us that really separates five feeling you know you you are free and that's that's exactly that's why we are on the weekend so much is it that the most important thing will just mail it sums it up perfectly I think whoever came up with that I or perhaps it's just sort of organically have popped out it's just it with sums up perfectly and I'm curious in terms of the marketing strategy in trying to figure out what has been working marking wise to expand your brand like I'm sure it's changed over time what were some of the key moments in the life of Teddy so far they've really to hockey stick serve grew the business in exposure what were some of those things that are really starting to work really well for you yes I say here out where we're one part lucky and won Park Guide to the lucky part is that we're able to put out content that people like and I have never marketed before my life written a ton of emails to my buddies but I have now written email than any corporate sense nor Rene advertising so being able to re connect with an audience in an insert to realize that people out there think alike I doing all the stuff was was was like for us and then today I was going to the pieces of the website and launch into ten relaunch the fall and right into winter so that's not short season we weren't seeing you know the key to growth there but we did is right and kind and generous every time friend or reading emails and social groups on college campuses or charities any sort of is this true to a source you can find contact info just email and said Hey this is overdoing it anybody's interested in working with us are becoming an ambassador for us let us know and and you know ninety percent of the time we got a reply that person was like yes I know somebody and it's me I like to see it here as your account forever and these are the reason was they just read the website email said that sounds ridiculous and it's and so that group was about thirty people but the ear immediately a source of kind of more driving more directive and also meanwhile we've been acquiring customers just organically which is still always our biggest customer acquisition channels just organic word of mouse and so those two things happen kind of coincidentally got to critical mass we also got the guys involved and we had was our first spring and that's when we bought the immigrated to get get us through the following summer and fall out of it within two months so her two weeks away so his interest was last six months last is too big and that's really kind of the first moment as we go along with a lot of other have huge win for us last year was another big win for us kind of been the more and more than senses last year we did three hundred and fifty million video views on this book and across kind of our channels in that with the huge winter from the content perspective and that was something where we've been working on content for a long time for all five and half years we've been running the business last year is that you're really unlocked it and once again it's it's this one part like you are good is we were lucky because we are able to bring in some extremely talented people and our content is found around and put up against any creative there and really started going we brought in to new hires like almost a year and a half ago and really started upping kind of both the output rate and also just like the creativity and that's kind of the more qualitative part but then we also institutionalized really concrete strategy and how we understand content the metrics were interested in and really apply to data driven approach to how we conduct that works like gangbusters for us that was that was another huge moment we have the growth of the business that we know that that hockey stick once again it's obvious that content has become the major things free as any <Music/Noise> his way has helped the guys get on the map and one I didn't mention earlier that liking created content that people liked and how can a person listening to this who has a physical product especially if they have a physical product how can they create this kind of awareness of their brand from the content like it's A OK years yet you have shorts like what you even start writing about and I'm curious how you address somebody who's asking themselves out like I have this product I don't even know what to write about I all I know is this product yet they thought about quite a bit I feel like the best analogy is think about the brand like about it like a person with personality and most more often than not the personalities going to be yours Trey as the designer as the person who's going to be writing or creating content so you know about the things that you care about right about the things that you have an emotional connection to you and that's really hard to find kernels and we're not knocking at the park every time I wrote but because we were pumped about it because you are passionate about it it enabled us to keep testing it right is a great book on copywriting called Hey Whipple squeeze This is more like advertising copywriting and one of the key tenets of tree to tree riding right just like a job right you have to crank through all sorts of bad ideas all sorts of bad content actually find that resonates with you what you find things that resonate with you that's when you need to see if what resonates with you resonate audience and an adoration and it's being willing to put content out and then having a healthy understanding of how to track metrics and understand magic so your body comes out an email tracking open rates click rates how people are bitten on the site from that traffic is if it's on Facebook there's all sorts of metrics have a point that rigor that you can search to develop your sense of pace make sure that your cases wind up with your audience is to say yes just started reading about things you care about and don't necessarily think about it from a business perspective of business has to be saying these things only after endorsing these products and doing that sort of thing when you don't necessarily care about that find the intersection of relates to the brand are trying to build a product you're trying to sell but also you really fundamentally care about it and it needs to be said for most and started reading through those concepts and see us start to resonate can show it to your friends show it to a group of people in your customer base if you have customers in the back and that will inform your case going forward that will get you better and better and better chance like this is our last years or if you're really really eclipsed a significant matter in the world of video prior to that I think three years ago we are on an annual basis regarding the thousand or five hundred thousand years and this year we did plant the last tree to tree and fifteen this is a process to take them time to get to that the real numbers but you're putting in the working you have the passion you already are light years above your competition what was the big difference if you don't mind sharing between a hundred to five hundred thousand years versus the three and fifty million year you had last year the Common is a content design is is really what we've been working on is this kind of miss the call a theory about the creatives of like you go to the creative about with the content that is get this work of art question for us to design the design process we apply startup methodology to content is really what we're doing is designing content as opposed to creating individual pieces and so it's this constant interplay with our community of what they like so I say first is we're putting out things that people weren't liking him as much second is warm so this book as a platform is just better for distribution for us at least so those early days were working a little more and YouTube as it was kind of more than you laugh your butt but Facebook Share to Facebook owns a share we're trying to create viral video content you really need to go directly to the source of the share because they're building up their own video class are now doing massive amounts of use so it's making sure you understand where your customer is and what the action is you want from your contacts in designing kind of bonus content and the distribution around that those two pieces where the two pieces hard work for us that there are quite a bit last year giving example of one of your more popular video is from last year in kind of what was in that video and also had that play a role in selling your choice yeah so so I'd be all answer the second part first so that the most significant way to require customers and the way the book by Alice is people talking this time and content yeah exact contents and the wee brain can sprout with the number one thing that you can talk about it was a product so product is controlled by the encounter group of people each of these that is not me and so I'm going to create a conversation will take on that mark most or less often than not people are going to be saying Hey I saw great you know the are at these guys wouldn't talk about it and a piece of cotton that connected with them in so so that that is like a huge huge huge and the Facebook shares a proxy the proxy for just a real life person conversation and this is so vital that's why we invest so much and the first parting the sea as well so we made inadvertently made one of the best performing ads of the Olympics and the kind of big international sporting event a measure of its legally allowed to say no we're fine here I think that but it's oh so we we were trying to think of what it was a kind of clearance around that event around the pitch and we have to wonder does want something I'd catch it so we thought hey what about men think that that's not a sport that and we don't quite know why not and that so we wanted for fully choreographed fully executed guys wearing nose plugs that the Bearcats and say they're sorry and we did we choreographed a cool video and then we got like the I can remember the ranking but we are in the top and the most watch ads of the Olympics beating out the very people who put millions millions of dollars by zooming in to their budgets for distribution and their production and down we spent maybe twenty five hundred dollars on shoes and a backyard or front cool and fro and that I was going to come to mind is like really really low budget where we're competing with monsters that really would depend on this same idea and once again features Yemeni I see the ad here now it's I think it's titled How do we add men's synchronized swimming to the Summer Games because it's the exact and I see that it's it's amazing how can you not talk about this day and when you see anything for the brand in the culture that you create in the personalities fits perfectly so lol Well done to you the content team I think it's fantastic I think also people listening to this it's going help them think out of the box tune it doesn't mean you have to create something ridiculous right it just means you have to create something on brand that we talked about essentially is what works what I'm trying to get out here and then I also talk about what you've done with your communities mentioned to me a few times the end it sees things that we normally hear about not related to an article of clothing but you've somehow been able to amass this amazing community and I'm sure this stems from the con to the craters well that how are you even more than the content in search of fostering this community it you've built an obviously when you have a comedian when you have fans I mean they're going to be there for you there to buy stuff but I'm curious what are the strategies involved with Australian and New York nurturing this community yet so so is not like we reuse community for content and social second meeting I try not to use it so much for advertising and direct response so they were putting out are posting organically is is not going to be sell we really don't like so I figured another Greatest salesman for what we are we're better at content and showing personality and interacting and that's really where we find and were racing their communities or form is when they're not cause that's that's one of the most important things don't don't try to sell so much more kind of create a relationship that creates demand yeah that's a thing of note is that I'm here new Instagram page have been looking for anything it says like go here by this or this is on sale I have been like going for days here I don't see any of that hopefully you don't mean that they won and even our mailing list which is very typically like a very very strong direct response from day one we've always said Friday that is just entirely caught and that was news and after that and we don't sell the Mary Don't You got that chance and give you fun things that were trying to create that future and authenticity that relationship is really important there than in the world of Instagram one of the things we saw from day one is that when people doubt the products and it was amazing and there are some of the most diverse people that one you know that's the fuel for its aggressive and so they were in serious need for ninety five percent of all the posts in there those customers we want to show you want to we want to get them on are just as much data and so we do we get probably thousands down kind of just photos that people are tagging isn't an every down to a goal we read this know if it's it's like ridiculous are a lot of personality or rethink it and you are good and that's the concern for us and that kind of reciprocity is really going with our community and that that Instagram that wouldn't exist without all of the people of the community that's a huge huge kind of exchange value there where where were their allies us to be the curators give them the content they were lying on them to descend this is ridiculous stuff and share and share with us kind of the weekend that they're adding that they had these experiences adding as much as we'd like to go do all this amazing stuff that our community oh yeah that's that's one thing it's really awesome and we did from once again we did from day one and whether it was you know our Instagram we always wanted to show is kind of the community that kind of to its farthest extent where I was fifteen we hired the male models out of our community of customers and people are fans of the brand and those are those of the models that we use so if you like that synchronized swimming video a couple of guys are just just means that we are the models and that and once again just how awesome you guys so much personality so much diversity which which is really cool as I think also like that's not super awesome cool is that and get involved in helping us kind of build this this ridiculous this ridiculous thing there were a lot of men from the outside here it's completely inspiring to see a company selling shorts have this kind of community <Music/Noise> I'm here I am right now I opened up the picture it's this guy I can relate because it's a guy wearing tan shorts the USA shorts with his son at on a doorstep and it's obviously a customer and even human at tag the customer here and it's just there raise their hands <Music/Noise> kind of thing up above that says father some level expert and the like that can exit the cell Well have you come up with those sort of mean related things I think that's something that obviously is working nowadays in terms of getting shares I mean most of the responses here in the comments are people at sharing with their friends this is us this is me in again there's no mention of the shorts there but they are obviously there are and because this is the brand I mean you're getting all this free exposure it's amazing who by Lee who comes up with those for you guys whoever is doing these means for you guys I don't know if it's a team or what but they're the really clever and they're very short but they're just perfect yeah that's that's that's our ritual and that's it Mason still Grant Garrett Wilhelm met him there and gaze so the theory is once again it's about value in making sure that you even if you don't feel inspired don't you like you that read this this whopper of a caption or of a cap that that kind of be content and Ukraine to keep reading keep trying to create that content and you know you combine that with extremely creative and talented people that is all of those guys and engines and about with my stuff and that's that's that's what we've been trying to build on the cross everything across a video that we produce the caption The roughly that we have this this rigorous edge too we wanted the best funniest out there I create content that makes people smile and laugh and even a destination that source of that will require hard work that requires us"
"10","Smart Passive Income Podcast","270_SPI_270__What_You_Need_to_Know_Before_You__Get_Physical__with_Richie_Norton.mp3","this is a smart has become podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred

<Music/Noise> during college is <Music/Noise> was <Music/Noise> see the morning m The supper ready thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> of the smart passing podcast really thankful you're here today and can be really interesting episode because we're going to dive into into the world of manufacturing in getting things sourced in getting prototypes and working with people in other countries to get those things done in shipping across the ocean in all these kinds of things related to getting a physical products dance if you're doing any sort of e commerce or if you're planning <Music/Noise> comments or selling through Amazon FDA or for example doing a Kickstarter campaign for some physical product idea that you have to get the ins and outs of that situation with a good fren of mine Richie Norton who was introduced to me by a good friend of ours Johnny Dumas from here on fire Richie and Jon worked together to launch and produce what's <Music/Noise> become a very popular journal now kind of a workbook called the Freedom <Music/Noise> also heard of the Mass Street Journal which John also polished Richie was a major component of that situation <Music/Noise> success so I've invited Richie on today to talk about this whole process of everything from <Music/Noise> manufacturing and shipping in <Music/Noise> you know how this it's just such an interesting conversation so whether you plan on doing physical products or not I'm actually undergoing an experiment myself right now with with physical product to hear more about that in a little bit but whether <Music/Noise> are going to <Music/Noise> the industry or not it's really interesting <Music/Noise> this all works and what can be done and what's possible to open your eyes to certain things that you might be seeing <Music/Noise> day so let's not wait <Music/Noise> Richie Norton from proud proud product together proud at come and also the author of The Tale of the power of starting something stupid and will talk about why that's the name in with me what it means in the NHL here's Richard Norton was so excited to be here <Music/Noise> they are really excited grateful to be here that you're the man in a year <Music/Noise> helped me quite a bit and I'm so excited to dive into a number of different things today as many people never <Music/Noise> the show right now this is sort of physical product month if you will in SP I knew help me alot already with my approach to my physical product experiment <Music/Noise> but first of all you also wrote this amazing book that's getting rave reviews it's called The Power of starting something stupid and I'll Swan dive into that as well but before all this I just wanna say again thank you and tell us how you got to wear out like this year one or two minute origin story like where did where did which Norton <Music/Noise> in it come from and how did you become an expert in all the stuff I won the stupidest one of all that's for sure or I And this or that all was a kid I asked my dad I want to get this idea he said is the worst thing I could say that maybe the best thing he's like you don't want a job I'm sixteen years old and my dad saw me not to get Mike was wrong with you Dad I want to make money that's not Dad's arms as they say that he said no if you work all summer with minimum wage whatever you're not going to make any money he said go tell from San Diego he says go to El Centro buy watermelons in the watermelon patch that are irregular size because they can't sell them to the grocery stores like OK I like take out the seeds in our minivan and we fill up my brother fill it with watermelons to the point where the cars like a full on Low Rider and I sell them on the fourth of July and make more money in one day that I would made the whole summer and so I realize they never trade my time for money everything changed so since then my first as I was in college I met this family from Mongolia I know like I got my star in real business in outer Mongolia sarcasm or company they're getting involved more with stuff in China and then as things go on internet becomes more popular eyes are getting into books online courses training speaking in addition to the physical products of that idea and how long <Music/Noise> this for like the online stuff about ten years more or less in the way every G I got connected with Ashley threw me to find ours Johnny Dumas who you own now and John is the very highly of Richie and I connected with them after that because it's you help John <Music/Noise> his stuff you might talk a little bit about what you done for him yet so podcasting I'm not there I don't have my own podcast yes I'm going to do it when I'm on a lot of podcasts is changed everything because it's a great way to reach people with a great message and it's usually beneficial for the listeners and so <Music/Noise> had me on his podcast basically happen is a listener of his inner reader of mine introduced us so I got his podcast at the end he asked something like what you like your next big thing well I have this company called proud that we held on for years source things from China because Allie Bob is not as are the best way to go in a week later and he's like really talking about that cool idea for the freedoms or no I explained to him how easy and or difficult it's going to be and I met with in San Diego and then we went from there so we help them he wrote the book he did everything he's amazing and we basically put the whole package together in sia everything from having him physically make it sip it organized or three of the warehousing and whereas ultimately does the fulfillment we helped orchestrate that part of it while he went off and did an amazing cakes are that four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in thirty three days and then <Music/Noise> on to the master journal which is crushing it to <Music/Noise> the rest is history yes yes absolutely <Music/Noise> the company your company's name is proud docked <Music/Noise> write what you say that's not a random accent you have like no its product its proud products are proud of proud of and having that domain is available and I'm like school are so proud to come proud U C T <Music/Noise> it too because you want to make a price that you can be proud <Music/Noise> that the more likely it is <Music/Noise> that's just common business mindset as <Music/Noise> speaking of that I want to talk about physical products help jail the help me live <Music/Noise> as some sort of consultation and connect me with the right people and at the time of this recording and still write and think it actually Richie I don't know if you even know but I <Music/Noise> collected a number of beta users who are going to be starting to use prototype versions of our calendars for the project and then it's going <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> sort of you know then we're going to Chinatown stuff but I love I think I saw something damn stories picture a little video of something I was like well he's making stuff happen I as at that school at school I know a lot of people the either have a business online <Music/Noise> which is doing fantastic and are doing courses <Music/Noise> stuff other people they want to start a business but it makes sense for the solutions they want to build to build a physical product and so the first question to ask you is What are the things that somebody needs to really consider before even making its decision to go into the physical product because it's neat to me it's not as <Music/Noise> OK Emma sat for an un teachable or something and seven on a course and then drive people into that I mean <Music/Noise> more to us the rundown on what what we need to know before we get into this cake I cut through all the fat just tell you exactly say what not to do and what to do what not to do is I think the U haf to do and be everything OK because if you're like I want to sell it to say which it I want to sell physical widget what many people think is now I have to learn how to make prototype then I had to learn how to manufacture it that I have to learn how to shift it warehouse that deliver it ends up happening is that process could cost them millions <Music/Noise> of dollars for example is in the manufacturing think of as the products they may contact me as I inherited some money and they wanted to sell organic chocolate and I'm like cool and there first thing was I It's been a million <Music/Noise> on a building I'm like I <Music/Noise> just look up private label chocolate bars and like let's have these done tomorrow to start selling brother yeah so you'll have to do everything they're people who are experts you have to be the master at orchestrating the whole thing right have any idea that is something that sell able make a consumable to the person trying to sell it ok that said you have to be everything because what happens is when you realize you have to be everything and it cost money and time just doing nothing exactly it's too big I will do I retired a million dollars yeah right you're never going to write for the action takers are tough right now here's what you do honestly I make this a try to make this so simple you have an idea for a physical product obviously Google it and if possible find it or something similar to it on Amazon find it like find your copy them not going to steal it you want <Music/Noise> it looks like and hummus are selling for because that's kind of the benchmark now you can assign a price higher lower I mean that's another whole story Bekah not want to know where it's at so the price in this thing it's a thirty bucks we have to assume there's all these in the middle how much they make this thing for Megan for a dollar five dollars ten dollars and then you can work backwards so if you're doing completely on your own I know hard on Alibaba that you could start there or global sources as other websites do but you will find this thing there is <Music/Noise> that thing and they're out there mean like somebody is creating meth in manufacturing it someone in China I mean ninety nine point five percent of the time and <Music/Noise> inside a clothing maybe can be somewhere else that usually <Music/Noise> stuff is tight now it's a lot of time and you would go to the alley or <Music/Noise> mention in <Music/Noise> as their alley the dot com It is for doing on your own not using a service like my mom or global sources dot com Those are my go to websites and a go there you type in i ok I'd type in fly fishing rod is a very tough yes they go we actually have a fly fishing to me by the way so the eye and you do it anyways so that you figure this out and you're like whoa there's all this stuff people are making and you know what they're probably not me might probably can tell you the brands that are using it but I'll tell you this I've been into fly fishing ride manufacturing place in the booties since I like booties booties beneath all the way make the reels on like this stuff and I'm like a Beacon to test these out in this as not is no rivers there's no way to go my way how do you know these things work and they said we don't we have no idea which is make what you guys tell us to make em like Oh that makes sense in that sense you to understand when you go to some like China if you tell them to make it wrong they will make it wrong because they don't know <Music/Noise> they care they want to make it right for you that's where it gets tricky because you might not know the thickness of the material is being used by that slices on Amazon because Amazon with a link it might tell you exactly what it's made at or close to it so you now have a starting point and if they don't tell you exactly what its mean you can literally <Music/Noise> that link to someone <Music/Noise> that's going to make it for you and there so I was in one we were at one factory were like making a skateboard helmets the little plastic of the helmet we went like this is he like put her fingers I and she says she says <Music/Noise> and a letter like what what what does that mean he said Oh that's the name of this type of plastic like she knew the number and letter of the material just by touching it how experts are experts tell you I get close to see send the link of what you want you're not going to copy it you're not going to steal a lot going there but it's a starting point and they can look at and they can go oh yeah we are to make that one or they'll say Yeah we can make that that point that's worth nothing tricky because you'll understand maybe you do like them when you contact someone in America it's like Yeah well you're done in whatever in China is getting hit by Americans are getting hit by every single country in the world every day and they don't know if you're real they don't know if you're a cop competitor they don't know if you're trying to get a free sample which happens every single day to them they don't know so they are throwing out some crazy <Music/Noise> to see if you know what you're talking about so they might say this is real is thirty bucks and if you say yes oh they know that you're an idiot and they're going to there is still the deal you they're going to take you for everything that has seen yet because now I'm telling this story because this actually happened I'm looking at are real and Mike is no brand on it like this thing looks really expensive there sunday thingy for like ten bucks not a joke is like going to Amazon right here in Zion they call it ya Amazon or they <Music/Noise> differently but I go into it and someone selling it on Amazon and eBay for three hundred dollars and I'm like but at the brand on the exact exact thing when I realize the brand is what sinus on this <Music/Noise> like search I'm looking at another real less the same <Music/Noise> with no brand on it and it's like fifty bucks in the comments on our This one is fake don't buy them like actually I the same exact day I so like tips and tricks that kind where you start but at some point you guys know what your quantity when you need to buy houses the shipping cost because the numbers will change if you want to buy a hundred they probably will even talk to you because they have maybe they will but they have the other opportunity costs that are shut down their line to make your thing for only a hundred the real costs are in like getting it started to get going it's not and just shooting off at her because yours is unique so they want to do bulk and so played in the smallmouth or largemouth bass with the Nikkei negotiations come into play and that's why products anybody can buy anything online great it's a concierge service they were like hey we zealously tiny as we go to trial we know we're talking about the good Alibaba you're probably not talking to manufacture anyways his own English there probably is the owner <Music/Noise> or the college girl in turn I just learn English and has no idea what's going on has asked her boss anyways so we come in and were like Hey we know the game were in USA this there's that does respect them it's all about that one key thing the relationships and the other day with us you get the best Apostle even better <Music/Noise> own but if you are doing a little plug for myself but when you could do it on your own that would be the process Kyle back and forth make sure it's real good sample test day and then go to town negotiating team orders maze you want ok let's go back to their real not real Arielle was a real example but it's also a real example when they found Amazon for three hundred <Music/Noise> for fifty because it was not branded the real story and I like it was insane ok so if if if I find that I mean is that a sign that that's a good opportunity <Music/Noise> that because it's only being sold for ten or like I mentioned <Music/Noise> not stealing <Music/Noise> in which you're not because they're just pulling <Music/Noise> but there's this big grand there that you said was already selling for three hundred why even <Music/Noise> route in first place or can you change it or you go so the thought of a second so people who are hearing is probably super confused right now because was a knock off was that not what is it so be careful but one thing happens in America are only good in America your passion is for America not the whole world so recognize that but once you take something for the country bringing into America where there is a pattern or copyright wherever it might be now you might be infringing so there's that second thing is that's kind of the mess is that size is knocking everybody off is not true it's or neighbor who sees your cool thing called sign and says my neighbors making it to make it to China isn't don't care there's going to make what you want it's your neighbor rips you off I know as a mother say that there are knock us out there aren't really for really huge brand name things for stuff they unite be creating some was going to rip it off it's going to be your neighbor and they're going ass tired to make it theirs that in this example that real was made by the manufacturer they own the rights to an hr and went there and said We like that one will you put our logo on it yet that's why we made it so in that case the thing is a kind exclusive agreement to manufacture can sell that seem real to everyone and now is the brand game right and that's that now if you were to go and say if that if that real was proprietary in some way like it's unique to them a really good manufacturer would not even shown it to me Rye and that you wouldn't see what's called a mold like how they actually create it none of that would be happening so that we have to be careful to a sometimes there's many factors that don't care but most of them the good ones you would never see that the end of the day yes great deal buy thing for ten dollars every day sell for thirty forty fifty or whatever <Music/Noise> and let people know you can literally <Music/Noise> guys this is the same thing that brand is doing I don't play that game or not you can say this is not some kind of knock off you can compare this test it thirty Day Money Back guarantee you know all the stuff you normally to sell it yeah that's a fantastic deal could you take something like that and say <Music/Noise> what I really like Israel obviously has big brands using it I would like to see an extra gear <Music/Noise> of an additional extra space to do something with their <Music/Noise> island percent ok so that so that's one thing go to Amazon As You Go There You Go I like this but I want to have this material this these colors on this added on I am not a lawyer I'm not like I know ANYTHING about every industry but there is a percentage might be twenty or Sam or less depends that something's different I'm not a legal person at a certain point if yours is different enough from something it's original it's not infringing I think it is different so there's that so here lies about that in the eat sign hundred percent find something tell me why this much different and go to town I mean that's what people do all along ok so now instead of going in and maybe maybe don't start <Music/Noise> finally you have an idea for a physical price on similar like my calendar <Music/Noise> which was initially she was just going to be a calendar <Music/Noise> it's a calendar <Music/Noise> a workbook for specific goals which is really cool it's actually really excited about it but initially we had talked about just the calendar right and I have presented the idea of the county I want <Music/Noise> interesting fun ways to keep track of certain things that <Music/Noise> different projects you know all of the same time in different ways to sort of show that on the counter so you know this isn't something that anybody's ever created so if you're coming up with something like that we can't go to a main factor doesn't that because that doesn't exist yet and that realm how do you start so a couple things are i e can just go to someone's him a kiss for me unless somehow miraculously is manufacturer has no engineer on board oh that's a whole separate thing that's kind of a nightmare to work is it could work as they say there's a possibility that could happen meaning they <Music/Noise> I could take your ID and it for you that's a possibility it's possible it's possible but rare ok it's really hard because even with all or expertise I'll be completely honest and email or phone call doesn't always translate perfectly from English to Chinese I had some flight you have to get back and go back and forth like that just part of it now so let's say you're in whatever country you're from we're America so you know fortunately <Music/Noise> like IT engineer ml engineers on hand but but but but I think because you're cool because you like an architect guy you can trust you can do things I want to see the person has no idea what to do of course with Google but at some point you have to somehow get the idea out of your head and onto paper whether it's a drawing or writing writing it down as the first at the second step is to talk to someone that could Haas a bully either make it or are pointing the right direction with what you did I And I'm like you know like make and I didn't know it was our talking like Oh I have this guy think he can do this and so at that point is really hard was it made as in so it depends if it's a piece of clothing or fabric I promise you there is someone even a freelancer online on work or wherever that will make you that thing same deal and scared all the awesome freelance websites all that stuff there is <Music/Noise> who's an ex read this and make it for you for a decent price even if it's a three D molding model thing <Music/Noise> it can happen then once he was in a cause that what the heck you're doing right but then once it's done you have that this whole thing in your hand this is the prototype essentially is the prototype and you're looking at here like this is not what I thought it would be okay or this is awesome or let's change it once you get that right and then us scale you should start means try and get quotes locally the oh how the shipping cost of things like that all tell you this I tried to get quotes and people who tried to unfortunately knock off like what Johnny Dumas is doing this is his book with the leather super fancy like this they're people I try to close in America has tried to see to see and I can tell you is costly will tell you that I have heard people tell me in America we can not make this it's to custom and I've had other who called means I try to tie the knot was doing they told me to be eighty dollars a book this is not a joke and I'm like what I <Music/Noise> so sometimes it makes sense to go overseas let's be honest so that when you want to scale you can send them prototype to them and they can reverse engineer it like once there they are magic they're so good at copying and doing exactly what you want a deal trying to get and understand what you are from your head is really impossible right once they have it game over or I then sent away you know how that made you know to scale yeah I mean in May in a in my calendar projects before the War Party came into play and I had a chat with you and I had a chat with an engineer friend that you point me to We <Music/Noise> long phone call about what this thing was going to be like and how is going to work and we came to conclusion to test our first prototype run in person three D printed some of it and <Music/Noise> one version of it and <Music/Noise> was like on wooden had plastic parts and Elise all these pieces into it and it works the way I had described but then when I was actually playing with it like this This is going to be cumbersome and are so many pieces here just as accents because what <Music/Noise> to happen is have specific colors that you could pick out that were clearly can put on top of the specific date CLC with what it was but you can start to color match like what's happening in Landon was really cool idea <Music/Noise> but then when I saw it being played out <Music/Noise> like baggy of all these different pieces like this is just Lego with happy I mean people are going to lose these things or step on them or maybe kids will choke on em or something so I came back I needed that prototype though in order to make those decisions it was super handy and I learned a lot and that's that's the whole purpose of prototype but if I get to the point where OK it's ready to go then i call or find <Music/Noise> China it's locally doesn't make sense to just have to send it to them or like Is that safe like sending a prototype like the only <Music/Noise> and then <Music/Noise> I I would start with pictures of course you know like pictures pictures pictures if they required actual product I would get a new you to make a second one I and hopefully the second one is less expensive than the first never know it again depends because I might have been done at cos my favor but supposedly the second one will have less time put in to its already there the first line I mean coming up with the As you've got a lot of work to dry then put in the CAD designer at its work was done it's done you can print it again which is never OK but whether it's safe to say in your second prototype design or not is obviously debatable xx likely rip it off will they do this and I will say you will <Music/Noise> actually happening you don't realize this because the area is getting there like saying why we even need someone <Music/Noise> what to make and then we sell it to the <Music/Noise> manufacturer spotlight wholesale and then they resell it a lot of are saying screw my own <Music/Noise> companies to brand them to whatever country you <Music/Noise> and you don't even know yours by say three to manufacture you don't even now it's happening all day long on Amazon as it gets up in the mail from Asia they know that's happening a lot in terms of finding a supplier meet Asher would be best to say that start with your network if you have somebody who can kind of pressure and then and then know this is my personal opinion first all piracy them security I mean am I afraid someone's going to rip you off and so instead you do nothing or so to anyone you have nothing anyways it's better to like take the risk that someone's going to steal your stuff in my opinion because in reality they're probably not going to steal a few off but it is better to try and have them or even often than not try it all came at least my personal opinion <Music/Noise> with that I mean this is what I talk been a vocal of I like when you have an idea share it with people because that feedback you get from people's much more valuable and then the con side of it which is maybe <Music/Noise> could take that idea <Music/Noise> instrument to do it so Yeah yeah so if USA and your fear was there to steal my butt off I guess it's a possibility it's very low because it was a new product they don't want to rip anything off it as Artie how the market I like a favorite there because of a largely self and say like it is probably not going to happen so you should feel okay like making this thing saying oh they're taking that risk and do every can make you happy in being the first market may be secondary guy do to get this thing done is way more important than the fear of everyone ripping off because yeah even if your neighbor did pick it up to twenty percent either thing that could happen anywhere anytime yes I mean happens every day so it is part of the world unfortunately athlete is but if you play the game got to play the game ok so have another entire <Music/Noise>"
"11","Smart Passive Income Podcast","271_An_Interview_with_Five-Minute_Journal_Founders_UJ_Ramdas_and_Alex_Ikonn.mp3","having a podcast with that plane session number two hundred and seventy one by the way to think in the The Welcome <Music/Noise> Income podcast <Music/Noise> working hours <Music/Noise> so you <Music/Noise> back and read <Music/Noise> and now <Music/Noise> over again Kate starts <Music/Noise> and that <Music/Noise> but fled in the Hey what's up everybody thank you so much for joining me today in a session of the Smart passive Income podcasts really thankful you're here and actually take a moment just express my gratitude for you for listening <Music/Noise> for the Z have left for abuse that is the who have subscribed a I truly truly mean that that relates to today's episode which is an interview with two amazing people EJ in Alex the founders of a tool they use every single day when I wake up in the morning and when I go to bed and that is the five minute journal this is something you may have heard me talk about before but this is something that I use every single day like I said so when I wake up i open this journal it's right there on my nightstand I write in it and what it does is it prophecy with a few questions <Music/Noise> one being What are you thankful for life and everyday we wake up like that it really sets the tone for the rest of the time that you're awake but even before you go to bed he come back to this journal right before you go to sleep and you talk about the great things that happened during the day and it's just three lines and also what's one thing you wish you would have done better and just doing this exercise <Music/Noise> change in my life in my mood and in what I get done and it's an amazing way to stay productive but also just remember about you know even though things may not always be great there are things to be grateful for and I just want to start the show to express my gratitude toward you but also set you up for this interview because Eugene Alex our amazing <Music/Noise> and we get into the story about how this journal came about I'll say dive into <Music/Noise> get this thing built and how they market it and what has happened since then we also get into a little bit of the science behind why expressing gratitude is important and I believe it's one of the most important things in the world this is a very common trait between all successful launch been yours or <Music/Noise> at least is they take time to reflect on what's amazing and I recommend that <Music/Noise> in the Jane Alex give you a little bit of a challenge <Music/Noise> well very simple to do but not easy to implement and by the way if you are a part of my book club which you can find at Pat's book Love dot com you will have <Music/Noise> that I have given away copies of the five minute journal before and I may just give away a few copies after this episode so make sure you stick around and listen all the way through I have a giveaway for you at the end for a few lucky winners and then finally sit back relax and <Music/Noise> with Hugh Jay and Alex from intelligent Change dot com and co founders of the five minute journal whatever I <Music/Noise> happy to welcome you Jay and Alex to the spy passing camp I guess the guys behind the five minute journal welcome to the show thank you both for being here we're really grateful to be here so we'll go one by one actually for each <Music/Noise> what you guys did before us came of this idea and <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> get started and just talk about kind of where like what you do before focusing on fine internal I know people change here clinic for Beaver chainsaws to help people get from point A to Point B with specific strategies <Music/Noise> actually move the needle because I think the market for that and I really care about people making real change and of those was part of my work before getting the fiber channel that's going to get to see ties in perfectly for went to find a journal became Alex tell you <Music/Noise> before finding eternal life crucify monitor on me my wife Mimi I find I would run a business a look see Aaron's the e commerce beauty business okay that's cool and I'm curious Alex if you can continue with Okay where did this idea if I'm in a journal cover and you actually know you day before this idea came about is actually a really great story I think the way you did that we may yet have a couple years of prior to the image or idea and you actually approach me because we are at an event a few years back and then he approached me because you are looking to start kind of lifestyle design business for work weeks in Paris at the time that's what I was doing with the businesses can use and <Music/Noise> out of the blue approached me said Hey I want to have a business like you have can help me and I'm like You're crazy and what a healthy and at the same time we had mutual interest and I said OK I'll go for coffee leads me to we met up and right away like OK this guy's very eccentric his little weird but he's very interesting and he's very into self help manner as I am and a lot of mutual trust and just be friends with others the meat from the time I said I can really help you create a business because I really believe him now specially about that time creating a business that you're fully aligned with the product is really resonate with who you <Music/Noise> try to make money just for money savings at the point after after myself just make the money isn't going to make a more fulfilled I think being a business that is tied with your purpose will provide you a lot more value than just having the money come in so that's the kind of how we met and how we pursued the idea from a journal and I guess the two are going to use the story of how the image or idea she was created an entry should <Music/Noise> are curious in terms of a cable like hindsight <Music/Noise> come about sometimes it was like right away and neither would continue our ducks in a park for four to five hours we have really become if that's all for some growth that we just read <Music/Noise> what each one of us was doing to help us just live our best lives and use as she hadn't but she is now an incredible incredible journey leads technique where you journal for like an hour two hours a day will dance like different journaling is for different results John for different results and so too is in the evening I had a practice where I answered about four to six questions that sometimes it took me longer to really get help help me get a strong <Music/Noise> of how the day go because I came across a really great quote that I think it isn't our job right now which is how you live your days is how you live your lives and it hit me because at the time I <Music/Noise> the way I want to live my life and oh so once I get every twenty four hours in the days to say yes twenty four hours what happened and I was talking to Alex about this and and be taught in gratitude and storing the morning the gratitude of the time to start his mornings with gratitude walks with me and to talk my habits and behavior and businesses in an ox like cute but we <Music/Noise> notebook helps people do this because nobody's going to do this though is that as you are going to get some supper at a book that house it much easier to help people to do it and and we just shook hands right there that's only because I just thought that uses being a yes with the best evening portion was probably fifteen to twenty minutes <Music/Noise> than twenty thirty average probably about fifty to sixty minutes a day and a very intense the journaling says that said you did this is great I would love to introduce my life but I wanted this in like five minutes a day and we also talked about this many how many self help books or self growth books whatever you call them bee hive all these great tips what to your life or you know there's also a great book at that time came out was Happiness advantage Bosh on a Harvard professor and yet where he did all these great studies of what gratitude can do to your overall well being or journaling <Music/Noise> affirmations or just all the stuff with actual signed by the proof that these things work but is all these books you read them but what about the follow through how to actually implement all these things into your daily life and that's where BJ came together because at that time like I said before our wee man really was it was usually looking for that news for that idea to create a business and I said well we have to wait until the right idea comes out and when we kind of we're talking about the This Is It This is the idea that can help us actually bring this gap and actually create a product the value and most importantly I was excited about this usually is a site about this because this <Music/Noise> would actually want to have in <Music/Noise> and use that will help us live better lives that's how I really believe the best products we started something that you want to have in your lives because I had a successful business prior <Music/Noise> will just use this five original idea as a way to help us launch a business <Music/Noise> and but it's really to help you understand how to create a business from scratch so I hope you and take you through this process of what it takes to create a lifestyle business and with this product and that's really how it started and we sold <Music/Noise> thousand units elsewhere goes <Music/Noise> but in reality I don't really care because I just wanted to have this product my life because I want to use it and practice it because I knew the power of design daily basis especially in writing because as you gay priests to mention my biggest thing that has changed my life the most in a meeting prior to the farmer drove to become financially successful in the pen of three was really the power of gratitude and it was really that simple habit you know yes we did the grads who walks in that tier of the sauce that but sometimes when my tendons cold I want to offer gratitude wash my school <Music/Noise> good at it so I just thought of as when I wake up the first thing that many do my habit of just think of the things I'm grateful for even be one thing and it took some time to get that habit but eventually I did and so that as soon as I woke up I just think of the first thing that great before and even just that one single habit is a hinge to anybody right now <Music/Noise> five hundred during the night that if you just install one habit right and that it is that is the habit of gratitude and just try to use up when you wake up in the morning just think of one thing I knew before <Music/Noise> off the debt credit to the end with the reason I challenge you to do that and you'll see that actually it's fairly challenging to re <Music/Noise> brainy to Ashley automatic think like this will take some time and that's why we all scream if I murder of that how can we create something that is kind of your buddy you know a certain way to help you guide through this process on a daily basis to help you really re wire brain and your thought process to help you think us with that way because the truth is many of us artists have really been we have created <Music/Noise> thought habits through media through school if their parents a lot of negativity and and that's what happens is a lot of us have that negative voice in our heads so how do you overcome the negative boys how to create new thought patterns and we really thought the merger is going to be the way to help people do that most appalling held us to that but I'm curious there's a lot of different parts to this but it's not just about gratitude which is obviously the most important thing I found and now just being conscious about gratitude When think before has massively change my oil field alley on life my mood to start the day and I think that's even for a love that challenge he gave to everybody to just wake up and start thinking about that right away actually fun fact that my kids school they do gratitude practices at my son's school to stem schools an awesome school yeah <Music/Noise> school it's got me <Music/Noise> all these other kinds of things that are benefiting benefiting is on you and how I can incorporate them into school so <Music/Noise> what age are at this kind of thing is really important and I'm curious though because like I'm looking at the book I love how it's not just like you know blank pages throughout the whole thing is like instructions there's science behind either stuff and I love that you put that there but there's more than just thinking about what you're thankful for there's also you know saying affirmations and the Ok will check in with yourself an eye and ask yourself OK well <Music/Noise> you would <Music/Noise> what do you wish you'd done better I would love to know the story about OK how this got structured the way it did and and because obviously you're telling a story asserts that the Battier and that's where it starts every single day but how is all this other stuff kind of put in <Music/Noise> different iterations <Music/Noise> model things that happen to get to where it's at now <Music/Noise> to start and take take that yes so of buses comes from positive psychology research in so I thought to actually do something <Music/Noise> about as Alex is talking is something that I think Chris are formed and do really like angry about something something that really bothers me is there's a <Music/Noise> we know so many tech stocks unhappy and books and stuff but there's <Music/Noise> of it and I was seeing that time in the work of young people and it was popular and it was bothering me that was a structure for applying these things in any consistent way and pas ecology was basically the idea that we can learn from people who have incredibly positive lies we can learn from people so typically the way that psychology is to have <Music/Noise> ago we took <Music/Noise> depression and needs to be like how we get people out of this which is not the ideal place to start don't want to learn <Music/Noise> from homeless person to whom <Music/Noise> rich rich person just so and then it took for some reason the nineteen eighties for the whole world psychology cum that fact and there's been very <Music/Noise> twenty thirty years about how to do this in the practice of gratitude is the very top something <Music/Noise> question you read on there is no baked a great and this is actually my third question <Music/Noise> the priming question and the Casa de from your brain Pat say you buy a new core book junk or I to do okay with the car the Tesla acts fantastic ok so you deftly when you were driving <Music/Noise> and that has liked especially when you started I bet you noticed every other test lehx around yeah absolutely <Music/Noise> I just ask the question <Music/Noise> its band has has some sort of name to forget the name but it's Sam and Charlie for John on Twitter here anyway has its particular activities yet are young yet so what the reason that works is because when you're in that corridor you brain is primed to notice these things around you the scores were likely already there you distort its noticed a very similar it's been proven that when you look forward to a positive experience in your day a large part of the happiness is actually the anticipation last even before I got the car knowing that it was like it was coming because with Tess is yet to order them had a timer <Music/Noise> like in June and had <Music/Noise> for it during that <Music/Noise> would spot every single test Landon <Music/Noise> about being <Music/Noise> absolutely right in Seoul the coop or is everybody who does the time a journal everyday you have that experience everyday and be good engineer that just asking yourself what would make today great because when they ride down there anticipating actually doing those things and in part the day and just the act of writing it down physically and spitting that improves happiness powerful powerful exercise the third questions about affirmations the daily affirmations and awe do you really powerful <Music/Noise> in English <Music/Noise> I am and whatever comes after that and the reason for that <Music/Noise> high today about by just building on us strong and consistent work ethic and what it does is it allows <Music/Noise> to strengthen a Porter dedicate our behaviors are correspond to the identity that we think we are if you think your cause or person and you write that down it's like a drop in the bucket over time your cursor to build a lot of strength in that belief and it just becomes part of what's been your experiences question I mean it's it's it's always one that confirms <Music/Noise> healthy and firm like who I <Music/Noise> to be in and <Music/Noise> to become I often use it to strengthen the values <Music/Noise> them on but I also use it to help me get to where I want to go as well for the first three questions credit to the priming and the affirmations us the first part of the five original <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> a five or journals or teacher might write something <Music/Noise> to something you do before you go to bed and helps move through the negative thoughts it kind of cleans away the cobwebs <Music/Noise> so he can remain sharp and if you'll feel great how <Music/Noise> did you have to go to of different versions of the book before you <Music/Noise> all out on to be counted I remember <Music/Noise> there being like straw conversations and important <Music/Noise> the content <Music/Noise> the quality of the book and she <Music/Noise> but I mean in terms of the continent a book how many <Music/Noise> before <Music/Noise> on something while we're still changing <Music/Noise> once in awhile the core <Music/Noise> very much I just I think huge and I knew the kind of questions <Music/Noise> to be in there and we knew <Music/Noise> from <Music/Noise> that we've both done together that these are very powerful questions and this is while so we have the introductory pages and description of how to approach each question it's very important because even for example the question What makes a great yarn around it oh I hope it's sunny like the London Eye can expect that to be sunny I can't do do anything about that best explains the people that when you write that you write it from the things that you cash impact and and how to do in your life so for me for example living in London I can't really control the weather or what I can control is the same thing like I'll go for run today and was saying that what I'm doing is I'm overcoming resistance and is <Music/Noise> maybe I would like to do but when Ash she write that down there's more chance of that happening and when Ashley doing that's why we'll see how the course and the evening which reaffirms the question is what three amazing things that happened today and those that evening portion helps us to reaffirm not only other new spontaneous things that happen throughout the day but also maybe the thing they have set out resulted in <Music/Noise> that you all is complete and I and the good <Music/Noise> ones where I used a three million to three will make a great and will see list three things and even portion she knocked out all three will allow the Great Basin <Music/Noise> and you go to bed happy <Music/Noise> happy you wake up n happy races amazing feedback to say I love that you include his questions and there was that kind of structure like that from the start before he started manufacturing <Music/Noise> that you kind of added later I mean it sounds like the kind of knew already the plan here to kind of achy ankle we had a pretty strong <Music/Noise> of looking back it's incredible that we're actually pretty aligned on on the product pretty early <Music/Noise> quick few details that we went back and forth on but the main bones of it was pretty free set did you test it with anybody before Hodges internal testing which is Try to ourselves and I would like to mention that as I sat in the beginning we're really creating this product for ourselves as a wee one of the Swiss Re the approach of business I think it is sissy you are away a sample of them all of the market and we knew that if we would enjoy <Music/Noise> product we knew it but other people like us would enjoy using as well and it's interesting because when people look at five in a draw now <Music/Noise> like This is so simple and especially now it's very kind of on trend of these journals <Music/Noise> of think we see when <Music/Noise> we started in a way that trend for these kind of journals that time there was no like why would I buy a journal that is pre filled out where I'm going to fill in my Stuff like to think about that we do we start to actually one of the reasons once again is that it's kind of my design aesthetic sense of mine because <Music/Noise> like well you had those journalists get nose like so much <Music/Noise> you distill it out but is still messy and the UGA <Music/Noise> that through our other products that were created of like the product of the planner although I can view to my own journal our life when things are very put together in a very aesthetic may look nice in it feel nice to actually want to use every bit his cell <Music/Noise> its great qualities <Music/Noise> like I I love the feel of it it becomes a <Music/Noise> ritual are and <Music/Noise> know it's I put on my nightstand or so is the first thing I do in the last thing I do and is it looks nice there it's not like you said not messy so I know a lot of quality way into I love this stamp name of it if I'm in turn on top which wants me to begin exploring the sort of okay this is a physical product I mean yes because of its idea I mean you could obviously turn into something digital eye and I believe you guys do have an app for it for people who don't get the physical book but I would highly recommend getting a physical because they're just like you said something with actually running it down I want to know what the thought process was and the journey through actually getting this thing created I want to <Music/Noise> Alex you're just talking when we continue with you talk about <Music/Noise> ok first steps they took to actually get this thing built yeah I think the way we approach that is once again as I said is we want to use everyday and you Jane <Music/Noise> to say bookstores and Tron Canada and we were going to we just look into products that we like and we would go through we look at how he just tells what kind of picture we wanted to use and we kind of collaboration and kind of put pieces together to the final thing and then <Music/Noise> work directly with the manufacturers we said this is what we want we want linen cover because it feels luxurious and it's very natural at the same time we don't want things like that especially when you have a product by about side you want something that's cozy you want something that's you know some people do you hug it <Music/Noise> is a search to search for the <Music/Noise> best just a friend that is applying it against their cheeks just because they love the way it feels <Music/Noise> its prey and I didn't <Music/Noise> win but what is weird <Music/Noise> like these are things that we look at because once again when you design stuff that you want to have in <Music/Noise> you look like what I like what do I enjoy and yes a kind of go through those things and so the process it was really just kind of you know it when you probably may be ordered Tesla you had a good opportunity to choose the kind of you know in Sera had or the color of the car was right and when you create a product I love about creating party I think cream pie was one of the bests like process is out there what it is because you get to choose all these features they'd like you know what kind of paper you want to use fonts that you want to use what was it was a picture can be lag and all these things was that age setting <Music/Noise> and how's going to be laid out and for me <Music/Noise> that this <Music/Noise> funnest parts of the product creation and probably one of the most enjoyable parts and I think what we're putting together <Music/Noise> thinking how can we make this product stand out how how can we make multiple Lee ourselves enjoy the product but also how can we make sure that others will also enjoy this product on their daily use because this <Music/Noise> on a daily basis have you have to like it if you get to be something <Music/Noise> for every day well you're the fallout have it pretty quickly in and are really our main goal is How can we help you get this habit into your daily life that can help you transform your life can change a life as it has done for us that now it when you finally go to bookstores and you kind of feel Ani like ok to be like this it's unlikely like this this material again would you go from there yea like how did you find a manufacturer to put that together feeling was that process like well you know this part of the process but the elbow of stuff the season tallied up to him and looked at several sentences <Music/Noise> suppliers and went back and forth for some of them some of them have really fast responses and in what they're doing on others really set in a generic responses and didn't really make the cut and <Music/Noise> forth with people as it had a good sense and diverse possums and and in new product <Music/Noise> line Taliban attack <Music/Noise> and then just start making calls yeah and then call us and I think the <Music/Noise> speaking which they use google translate well ah I guess most of all is that you have the ability to with this type of product where it's still not that expensive to order for sample so a full out and this I think the important for anybody who's starting a business it's a team gets the all although it may cost extra before you order a thousand or ten thousand units it's still better to spend that extra money to have a full sample mail out to see how a lookalike and went huge and I went ahead with that first even sample order we said OK we want this first full sample made with even <Music/Noise> like crazy <Music/Noise> right yes we want print on the inside because they can steal and a blank will be more expensive they'll do the whole princess is due to full shebang was the prince thing I think it costs anywhere from three to five hundred dollars for samples more <Music/Noise> we got at least for now but at that time we got it and we look that you don't read if we are in love from the Jewish Shas them you know anybody who has created product or even think about creating products sometimes things do fall in place and went uber you have to have that feeling where you like you know I won out I still write I feel I can bring this in the marketplace and or react well because the So you want to weigh what we want to approach as well if this would sit on bookshelves and the Barnes and Nobles or Indigo there in Canada would look professional and kind of makes other products there and would it even night and as we look professional but would stand out would this be something that people would want to grab two and buy for themselves because if you think about it resell right now"

Erica Baker from The Baker's dot tv so wasn't too long ago on Twitter and on Facebook I had said hey guys do you know any couples or partners who have created a business together and I got <Music/Noise> of suggestions all great actually looked into them the reason for this is because I wanted to know what it was like to interview <Music/Noise> who was working with somebody else in building a business together right for me it's just me and I started this thing on my own I wanted to see what it likes to to to have two people who started something together is of course there are a lot of people who had friends working together they were people who had just business partners to the literally found each other because <Music/Noise> this business together and then they became friends and then there were the bakers acres that TV I had about <Music/Noise> tweets and emails and facebook messages from people who are saying that I had to have the bakers on Brian and Ericka and I followed up an apple wine in these because they're so <Music/Noise> because they're so transparent so with a dual at the Baker's that TV they help people make sense <Music/Noise> and they do this by connecting truly a very transparent and authentic way with their audience and they built this massive crowd of raving fans by doing so through a number of different channels specifically Live streams for a lot of things and <Music/Noise> if they're going through a fighter something they share in the talk about communication and they've really built a lot of trust over time with their audience <Music/Noise> of course being a husband wife combo they built this business that they now have together they also have really smart ways of actually getting people on their email listening and they're talking about relationships and communication and we talk alot about that in this episode to say not just how they started their business together but also I want to gain some tips from them in terms of OK few have a partnership or you're thinking about starting a partnership or no matter what kind of partnership you have even if it's outside of business maybe it's for a relationship that you have with somebody how can you best communicate so that you can work things out and that's where the show will come into play some really excited to feature both Brian Erica Baker from The Baker's dot tv <Music/Noise> let's get right into it everybody and so happy to welcome Brian Erica Baker to the show today Brian Erica thank you so much for being <Music/Noise> has a compact has a hairy guys doing we're doing great thank you for having us absolutely you know <Music/Noise> this question to my audience not too long <Music/Noise> any couples or partners who started their <Music/Noise> together and <Music/Noise> things and I've got a lot of people who answer to this person or this company but I had gotten about fifty different people say you've got to interview Erica and <Music/Noise> and sake dun <Music/Noise> that social proof at its finest right <Music/Noise> get into how that happened in the air when I start with you tell me <Music/Noise> lazy white <Music/Noise> that raving fans right now well we work on lying with men and women with a desire to create easy communication and deep connections <Music/Noise> so <Music/Noise> through our blind we do weekly at least weekly live in these videos on line course we do private coaching and <Music/Noise> great cooking <Music/Noise> he spends wow <Music/Noise> surrounding the idea of just helping his is couples your rabbit are Brian in terms of if you know who <Music/Noise> here on I would sit in those of our followers are on in romantic relationships but we've had a lot of people they reached out to Aston they follow <Music/Noise> and everything in there like a I'm <Music/Noise> right now that things you are sharing are really speaking to me and are preparing you for or on forensic relationship Sunday as well as friendships and work relationships and all that so we kind of switched years to open it up to you on to prepare people for any kind of relationship release him Brian what's the URL where people can find out where you guys are at it because that TV makers dot tv ok Sarah talk about the origin story of the bakers that he <Music/Noise> got started here yet so we always had a desire to serve others and we are most important thing with Brian's background in ministry we knew that there is something that we were meant to do in particular we just never seem to thing and that box that we are always gesture trying to find my car stays and on in corporate world and so we kept searching and just basically doing on personal development trying to figure out you know what gifts we had and finally someone passes away what do people come to you guys nationally for and I that that means Ainge was a relationship coaching or counseling Brown Brian was a pastor for almost five years that's when people started seeking guidance and then <Music/Noise> combining <Music/Noise> on and people <Music/Noise> liked that answer having just one person you're talking about <Music/Noise> or shouldn't do we talked about us from <Music/Noise> quite where we came from we've always struggled with relationships is always struggled with communication <Music/Noise> and how that impacted our <Music/Noise> and quite frankly we <Music/Noise> I was so awful we heard all the time and you know he he would get offended because you feel like I was saying he was due bed and <Music/Noise> was doing and I would then happen then we sat down and I would get offended because you know it was like a vicious cycle and it's just what <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> to dig our way out of that that's that's a habit that we have formed and so we being the people we are to yourself better you know that our selves we and mentors we robots I tried to figure out <Music/Noise> what this looks like for us to have like a real working relationship and communication and it doesn't come natural and you have to work guy and went to <Music/Noise> like we can make this into a rhythm that other people could utilize a swell time that Brian would would you <Music/Noise> email ll la Paz on that topic is just better communication <Music/Noise> and the in a couple minutes can you give <Music/Noise> is going through a had just described <Music/Noise> of that miscommunication <Music/Noise> bitter feelings toward another how can one <Music/Noise> to start or at least put themselves <Music/Noise> the right direction as sort of getting out and starting to communicate better with each other yes I would say a lot <Music/Noise> kind of starts with I'm just kind of discovering who you are so I'm kind of the bases for the issues that you have <Music/Noise> and a lot of times the reasons you're not getting along so we developed something called a corny squares I kind of helps you develop what you need from a relationship so whether that is someone to just let you know I believe <Music/Noise> or <Music/Noise> there for you on so from there on you can kind of figure out what uni and and <Music/Noise> partner your friend your co worker whatever can and that's how you walk through that one from there I would say a HUGE is work on kind of some basic steps and communication so that's that the next thing we <Music/Noise> people through we have on something called six test you easy communication and say it's just starting out and creating <Music/Noise> safe place and Zoe Tay said take a break from each other if you need to feel like a thirty minute breaks the <Music/Noise> eye the <Music/Noise> eye yet taking the space to calm down yes green is kinder to each other <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> gonna re establish the fact that you are there for each other you're on the same team you <Music/Noise> or reason in <Music/Noise> added to the fact that on regard is that we're not on the same page right now we're working towards seeing things and we want to get through this together I love that I think that applies to all kinds of relationships not just romantic ones but friendships and obviously business partnerships to which we're talking a lot about this <Music/Noise> because a lot of people compare business partnerships to well marriages <Music/Noise> hopefully that helps people out or perhaps at this moment going through some tough times and I want to continue <Music/Noise> your story <Music/Noise> of OK you've <Music/Noise> but then you've fought and out of that you need a DD had mentors and coaches and counselors like he said <Music/Noise> then <Music/Noise> we can bring other people along with us and help people and serve <Music/Noise> in and curious were <Music/Noise> of doubts when <Music/Noise> like almost questions like Who <Music/Noise> teach other people's stuff or was it just felt like this calling her or can feel <Music/Noise> just had to do it and either you can take that question I being I were a lot of rumors a few like question themselves constantly high after eighty eight so it's that whole in postures and around and <Music/Noise> to hear more <Music/Noise> Nick Oliva and ninety km even wrote a article on that and it's basically feeling like you're just not good enough to talk about that and we felt that time and I think that we just need to re center ourselves the fact that you even pay honor and say we're not you know certified counselors we didn't get our degrees in psychology but we can bring to the table is our personal experiences and how we were Saran is not going to be the same for everybody but I know a lot of people resonate with us and that's why we've decided to share our journey and we are okay with completely being <Music/Noise> and open about everything I believe we have <Music/Noise> of things that aren't easy to talk about that we've gone to in the past and we've been on welfare if I when we had our first year kids and I was pregnant with our third we actually didn't have jobs or home so <Music/Noise> of things that we've gone through that maybe people can relate to only parts or her story by I just re centering ourselves that we're just telling your story to help encourage people that we do have a way that could possibly how right how did you start telling a story together to the world uh yeah I was seated area connected with Nicole Walters she's always been there has <Music/Noise> eager to you to seek out mentors and find people a day that how <Music/Noise> in so she kind of legal fate and she's like I love because she's amazing <Music/Noise> want her to be in our corner she reached out to Nicole and said how I connected you I become what you are and Nicole reached back and I called her and we are both super excited and I so she has walked us through like so this is what we want to do how do we begin this process how do we turn this into <Music/Noise> a passion but awaits you to change our lives to change other people's lives and to make a business from it on the coals one k One <Music/Noise> I initially <Music/Noise> I having her as <Music/Noise> that's how we started on the journey of like OK taking this passion that we are very <Music/Noise> and you know not sure how to tell or story to you well we have today and that had only started last August while not very long ago I mean that's less than a year ago at this point in coming out of that was the big realization <Music/Noise> what was the kind of aha moments he that came at her and that really helps you get the right foot forward I think a lot of it was the good days on was what we are to mentioned <Music/Noise> just kind of these are the passions that we have <Music/Noise> the things that people are coming to us for we were <Music/Noise> with <Music/Noise> how we find our place and so that's what we decided to step into and how to you and decided to monetize that he was OK to my eyes at but it's okay to <Music/Noise> from something you're passionate <Music/Noise> so had to be how do you even <Music/Noise> what what platforms <Music/Noise> start yes oh how we started I dream that was just Facebook Live videos is our biggest following <Music/Noise> just showing up consistently and listening to our audience and what their wines you hear about and constantly asking them you know what is going on <Music/Noise> that you would want us to talk about and then <Music/Noise> at interacting with them making sure that they understand that they're <Music/Noise> that we do everything and then from there we created I am on line course and dad right now is are mean <Music/Noise> also have a you know affiliates and Amazon <Music/Noise> and you know a person's all of us but we are on MC or six steps to ease the Haitian <Music/Noise> our life coaching and everything is done online so it's at the video that's cool lol If Facebook lively quick tell me about your process for going live Brian like how often you guys go live what's the set up blank as we get a feel for what kind what these interactions like with your audience can definitely say we try to keep it pretty consistent on every <Music/Noise> he sometimes life gets in the way and we both work full time jobs and we have three kids three two <Music/Noise> lot so it doesn't always happen but we try to stay consistent with that and we just use content from the feedback that we've gotten from our followers that things there and that they are struggling with or want to know more about <Music/Noise> as the things they <Music/Noise> from our own relationship and have seen over and over This is a problem <Music/Noise> and these are the ways we have come to a resolution in those areas in and in some of the stuff that we talk about too is the stuff that people are uncomfortable to talk about we decided to try to tackle those in and sit in that country was <Music/Noise> with them because a lot of people wanna know like the fifteen you know best date nights and stuff and we can talk about that war and <Music/Noise> on my finances but you know there's things are topics that people don't wanna talk about like me feeling like you're a horrible parent you know when you're trying to create a business on how to create boundaries when you're building a business between you and your spouse whether they're in the business with you or not which I had actually started a business by myself before we did this one together so we've experienced both sides are even things like um sex from a guy's perspective Brian Ashley was just featured on elephant Journal and fur and blood that he wrote that over ninety four thousand <Music/Noise> on and it's because we're talking about subjects that people are afraid to talk about them and so you're able to build this community and so people are coming <Music/Noise> to you direct them anywhere <Music/Noise> you kind of getting them to come back to the website <Music/Noise> which you know are there any call to actions are we selling <Music/Noise> live <Music/Noise> like walking through sort of you know what happens after the city has done each week on Monday yes there's always a call to action varies week to week and no we are not selling them every time I personally am not a huge fan of that but I do want to make sure they know what resources are <Music/Noise> if they choose to go that way and we also <Music/Noise> e mails with our our blocks and to everybody <Music/Noise> went because we have a weekly poor plot gets released as well time that is derived from our live video as well as quotes and things like that are sent out on our Facebook page throughout the week coral eating with the unit we talk about and so then we had a call to action for them to either the best and everything that they can have access to or on a discount on one or promotion on one of our courses or promotion dine on twenty <Music/Noise> session with eyes I mean there's always something to do and sometimes it's just reading a buck and that we've suggested the call to action and which will have a link on our page for so we're really starting to interview key boss as well during her live videos so that's another way that we've been having people interact with us that circle as you're building this business and <Music/Noise> just kind of taken off now which is fantastic what <Music/Noise> to serve together with the business <Music/Noise> of the way it's growing like Are there any things <Music/Noise> end differently <Music/Noise> any parts that you wish could be done little easier the city is struggling with how it has definitely been schedule especially I mean we talk about artifact that we work full time jobs and three is three under on <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> raising his business so it's taken <Music/Noise> of intentionality to make sure that our kids still had parents say they live and know <Music/Noise> we have to make sure that our <Music/Noise> stays together because if it falls apart the most successful business in the world Anais Nin not worth it in our eyes so we have to make <Music/Noise> make time for each other so for us every Thursday night we just turn off our phones turn off everything in saying I know you're busy <Music/Noise> things we can be doing <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> is it Saturday night so we'll just spend time together check in with each other see how things are going to get some <Music/Noise> I did a nine ball action Thursday night stay with my life <Music/Noise> it's it's it's incredible <Music/Noise> much even just a few hours together <Music/Noise> off like he said is just can to to to reinvigorate the release it to get motivated <Music/Noise> to continue <Music/Noise> an hour and <Music/Noise> dis question <Music/Noise> that's fantastic we actually created a box required disconnect to reconnect box because I was struggling with seeing my phone <Music/Noise> checking it because they know that there is something that honors Monday of the Out Of sight Out of Mind on and so we created the stocks that we know it goes in there can charge was in there and we don't rush it for us than ie and we actually did not know that you had responded to our Twitter verse of the few posts I'm saying <Music/Noise> to set up a times you interact with us an interview us because we're actually on the night in our phones are in our box as so funny when I thought it was holey areas that they all knew before us and we didn't known to the next morning sell well you have an <Music/Noise> talk about them really quick if you can <Music/Noise> on their behalf why <Music/Noise> are raving about what you both do I think it's because they bring an element of realness I then Jenny when they know that where for them and we know <Music/Noise> want to see them succeed in <Music/Noise> and are not going to be the mother just laugh and that I if they're going through hard times that we create a safe place for them to talk about it and not feel bad about it but actually feel good that they're even trying to better <Music/Noise> and that we make them know that they're not alone an answer as well the the I was thinking the same thing that she was I was a bit it seems like people are <Music/Noise> impressed with the fact with just how much things have grown and the fact that we don't just talk about wanting to serve in and talk about doing good business but because we are so passionate about this and because we want to see relationships restored and we want to see this really do well we're putting the work and in growing <Music/Noise> and it's only been a couple months now that we've really been a blast at the community help out in ways it has in and grow its way to say I think this piece that speaks so highly to <Music/Noise> this community ran like this level one which is people falling even finding you on Google <Music/Noise> blogging posts they only <Music/Noise> of who you <Music/Noise> have to live video which is just that's that's real life re <Music/Noise> I think that your community speaks so <Music/Noise> to you guys because of just how much you're letting <Music/Noise> on who <Music/Noise> the types of people you are and I think it's fantastic so we hurried <Music/Noise> couple months now it's live videos is is absolutely huge or you guys always comfortable <Music/Noise> at first for you I see for myself first and then out of the year I got use to live video a little bit with my my past business I was and all and I as a Beach Body Coach and so <Music/Noise> being more comfortable <Music/Noise> through that I was a little bit of a safer topic because I feel like everyone's been talking about <Music/Noise> on <Music/Noise> sharing <Music/Noise> journey on it and so that's where I started and I saw the freedom that came from that since I saw on the power that it had to encourage others and so i addicted to it and hides my insecurities to this I am so that I could help serve <Music/Noise> the best I could <Music/Noise> get in and that's how I got comfortable with it I still get nervous now he has recently topped a bounce and going <Music/Noise> impromptu off the cuff which is <Music/Noise> you but Catholics such as like when we <Music/Noise> Satan and we have talked about it and then <Music/Noise> afterwards and being vulnerable <Music/Noise> moment of you know this is kind <Music/Noise> and that God's heart is really hard because it's in that moment you know it's a little easier if you're like us to train in <Music/Noise> of sharing that means the whole time then <Music/Noise> sun I am getting more comfortable with the cycle is something that me was the difficulty to get started with yet that night so it's really fine like one on one conversation I'm usually fairly comfortable <Music/Noise> training group setting I'm super awkward and surveys the glass for whatever reason super operator lease was starting out I won a stage and completely fine with it there something about bass line like not <Music/Noise> it is super uncomfortable to <Music/Noise> instant feedback and not knowing like people may think I'm crazy <Music/Noise> but you still doing <Music/Noise> ask you why because because I believe <Music/Noise> doing and we've seen the benefits are <Music/Noise> and it doesn't just affect your relationship when your relationship is terrible at Lehi High seems like it's terrible when you don't have those people in your corner <Music/Noise> it's great friends <Music/Noise> the sow sow or know someone you're <Music/Noise> don't have that person is in your corner it's going to love <Music/Noise> take care of you especially when it's on the opposition you go home to someone that makes your life more difficult it changes everything so we've seen the power <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> makes it worth it to face your fears and go out and do the things that you're not comfortable with and talk about things in there we want to talk about this because we've seen power <Music/Noise> with other people love it now ask you again talking about the relationships and working together like how did start when you both work OK we're going to turn this thing into a <Music/Noise> people are going to go online <Music/Noise> scheduling to do is get stuff to take care of how are you How are you able to kind of work together in that way and what devices are tools <Music/Noise> strategies do you <Music/Noise> are implemented to make sure the guys to work well together skits to know what that kind of dynamic is like yeahh when we first start and I Brian wasn't quite sure what his role was in it I <Music/Noise> obvious that content because that's what he basically did as a pastor was As the meantime ten piece and I was used to creating a business previously so I was trying to involve him in every aspect is like sitting there and we would have arguments over whether <Music/Noise> it seem like you don't want her to say and when we finally talked about <Music/Noise> the business is that he didn't feel like yours bring value and it was stuff he wasn't good at so <Music/Noise> that it's okay to not be involved in everything together that there's things that he's good at there's things I'm <Music/Noise> there's things that will do together <Music/Noise> just talking about that in trial and error figuring out what those are he don't <Music/Noise> was huge for us on and then I would say <Music/Noise> that we on the news we <Music/Noise> highly <Music/Noise> our calendar and if you are scheduling and time locking everything I also get dropped and I am that that is probably the biggest thing we had just sat down the other day schedule and rest because that is you keep going <Music/Noise> but if you are scheduling time for rest and you're not <Music/Noise> able to help fill of anybody out of your house and be totally totally I mean I schedule in my morning <Music/Noise> of things to <Music/Noise> stay focused and have breathing room like meditation <Music/Noise> in all this American morning stuff that talked about on the show before I I mean it when when times get tough in yellow <Music/Noise> special you in in and around the work a serene and like I said sometimes a wee and fights with our business partners or whatever like hey what's the best way or <Music/Noise> recommend <Music/Noise> both approach solving those problems in kind if you know putting those fires Aussies can continue on and get stuff done but <Music/Noise> been a good mood again and the sometimes years the outside perspective to help ask questions because we're trying to articulate on this day everything stems back to if you're having <Music/Noise> stems back to some type of corny door and wounding <Music/Noise> is getting you some feedback that either you're not good and I hear <Music/Noise>"
"13","Smart Passive Income Podcast","273_7_Powerful_Things_That_Can_Happen_as_a_Result_of_Starting_a_Podcast.mp3","this is the Smart passive Income podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred and seventy three before it started just wanna say Thank You The The Welcome <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> back and <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> before he goes to bed he <Music/Noise> Who <Music/Noise> Pat Flynn the butts up every path in here and thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> the Smart passive Income podcast and guess what it's just you and me today no guests on this episode haven't actually done a <Music/Noise> really sad about this and I wanted to start like I said earlier we're thinking of not just for listening to this episode but for everybody who has listened to any episodes of any of my podcasts out there whether it's the show or the ASP at podcast or even <Music/Noise> I just wanted to take a quick moment to think you because you <Music/Noise> changed my life the course of this business and the podcast I wanted to talk about today in terms of what has all happened since starting my podcast nine a lot of you already have it I guess and this can potentially be a great reminder for you about <Music/Noise> what we do beyond just being kind of fun but I know there's a lot of you out there who are thinking <Music/Noise> a podcast as well and you might be on offense because you know that it's not an easy thing it's not as easy <Music/Noise> up a bloggin just clicking a couple buttons and then poof you have your blogg podcast does take some time and it is a commitment to do but it is a life changing and I want to take you back to two thousand and eight this is December two thousand actually smart has a thing cannot calm has only been around for a couple months this point and I was determined to start a podcast because like I said earlier Pike has changed my life when I was going through my layoff and had a couple months left till my termination day this is mid two thousand a podcast that I discovered called Internet Business mastery which is still around that opened up my eyes to everything that was possible it was interviews on that particular show that gave me the inspiration to start my own business to help people the architecture space related to an exam <Music/Noise> taken when I was an architect and that just completely changed my life so I always knew that a podcast was an amazing <Music/Noise> actually change a person's life because it had changed mine so I wanted to start one so in December of two thousand eight I published on my passive income dot com a blog post with an audio file is my very first audio file they had ever published online and it told the world even though there weren't that many people my block at that time had just started but still it was a public announcement that had this urge to start a podcast I bought all this equipment and here's what I published in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> as a pat from the Smart passive Income bog thanks for taking the time to listen to this I think that's so awesome that a you know you're helping me out figure out his new podcasting stuff I'm actually just bought a whole bunch of podcasting equipment for myself because I mean I listen to a lot of podcasts I figured hey mind you and so I mean really I <Music/Noise> going to talk about yet so I just wanted to get familiar with all the equipment I <Music/Noise> what it's like to post something on mine and hear what people think about it so I mean he'd tell me should aim to give up on podcasting and is my voice sucks so bad or should I talk a little deeper or I really <Music/Noise> so again just thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me keep going back to the website had tons of information coming up in the near future and let's make two thousand and nine Gray year for all of us let's make it let's make it the most profitable year we've ever had and yeah I'll try my best to help you get there so again good luck with everything happy holidays and this is Pat Flynn from the Smart passive Income signing a peace <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> in <Music/Noise> the ass so I mean the rock knees ache you can tell that my I'm just not confident but I had this urge to start upon guess I always knew it's what I wanted to do well here's the thing that was December of two thousand ate my very first episode didn't come out until July of two thousand and ten so a year and a half later <Music/Noise> many things that were stopping me from moving forward with starting my podcast it took that long to do a number of things one just get over myself because I was just too afraid to put myself out there with podcasting it's not like Laos where you can just easily delete the word that you misspelled and or re spell it the correct way this was your voice right and <Music/Noise> it's not just what you say it's how you say it and the <Music/Noise> and the maidens and all the stuff and <Music/Noise> happy with the content that is producing so I just never published anything out there plus there was a little bit of a technical hurdle to overcome as <Music/Noise> a lot of people online who are helping me at the time for example Jason <Music/Noise> from Internet Business mastery who had a lot of information to help on casters and also Cliff Ravens crash from podcast answer Man dot com is a huge help to me as well now I finally published the first episode just to give you an idea of what that was like Well actually recorded that episode three <Music/Noise> times the first time I recorded it kind of off the cuff I didn't really plan it was essentially an introduction episode shared a little bit about who I <Music/Noise> in what the show's going to be about what kinds of episodes were going to be coming out scene but even as just <Music/Noise> the episode and just not being happy with it at all there was just no confidence in my voice and <Music/Noise> of random pauses <Music/Noise> comes in those kinds of things so I did was I scripted out everything I was going to say I spent about two and half hours writing down every single <Music/Noise> that I want to say so that I could get a perfect thing it right remember re recording its second time around reading it off and re <Music/Noise> animals putting myself to sleep it was almost like I was in a lecture back in college after lunch all tired from eating and eyes was tired and bored and that I just I can handle that was very robotic there's no <Music/Noise> that's what happens when the script out what is the chicken a present or share on things like podcasts to the third time I made a decision I decided that I was just going to put out there I had a couple run throughs already <Music/Noise> wanted the same basically had outlined it now and then I just hit record and I went with it and I tell myself you know what if I make mistakes screw it I'm just going to move forward and get through the muck and then get this first episode and I'm so glad I did that because now two hundred <Music/Noise> two episodes later on the Smart passive Income podcast plus nearly a thousand episodes on ask Pat just so thankful for all the amazing things have happened since letting myself go and just getting started may I think is Johnny <Music/Noise> amazing podcast or find me on fire who said every master starts as a disaster and it was definitely feeling like that way for me when I was just starting I definitely felt like a disaster but a hypothesis episodes that are still available you can listen to them they're great content especially once I started doing <Music/Noise> have to think Mark Mason <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> from late night I am calm like I said after getting started after seeing the results of what has happened since starting my podcasts here's the thing I only wish I'd started sooner I only wish after announced that I want to start a podcast in <Music/Noise> wait that I got over that fear much faster and I just started that sometimes we have to do just have to get started sometimes take the rest of this episode to talk about specific things that happened as a result of starting a podcast because I feel like a podcast is today the number one platform that you can use to gain exposure for your brand to build a relationship with her audience and to really help put yourself on the map now it's something that I know a lot of people have done soley they've built their business as a result of their podcast that they started and a lot of people who have a brand <Music/Noise> and inserted a podcast essentially power up their brand and which ever way it is or which ever way you're going to share with you seven powerful things that can happen as a result of starting a podcast to number one your message will have more reach the message <Music/Noise> reaching this is something that I didn't <Music/Noise> happen I mean you're going to have it because I know there's people who only <Music/Noise> stuff out there they don't want to view <Music/Noise> want to read long posts The prefer to listen in especially with the way podcasting is you can listen on the go your message can be <Music/Noise> into people's lives where no other content can be inserted for example on a walk or driving a car in all this kinds of things I don't know <Music/Noise> to a podcast right now but I would guess that it be a lot more difficult for you to watch a video especially when at this length or read a blog post versus listening you get that passive <Music/Noise> but also <Music/Noise> gets inserted into people's lives lot more so your message is going to have more reach because there are more opportunities for people to discover you but not only that here's the cool thing your message will also have more impact because of the power of voice so you're <Music/Noise> episode right now you're listening to my voice it's much different than reading a blogger's if you were to read the transcript of this for example you lose the emotion behind what it is that <Music/Noise> you lose the day that the kittens <Music/Noise> in <Music/Noise> and you can do a lot of things with your voice to have a much more powerful impact similar to when people are on stage and they start to slow down a little bit to really emphasize a point or they might feel excited and you can feel that too on the other end right so there's a lot of things as a lad dimensions the podcasting and as a result of your <Music/Noise> stronger it's going to be more <Music/Noise> pushed out there more <Music/Noise> more exposure now I know this is happening because I look at the data I've ran surveys in my audience several times and each time it tells me that the podcast is the number <Music/Noise> that people have found out about me and my brand this is <Music/Noise> surprising to me in two <Music/Noise> the first ever <Music/Noise> after I had certain my podcast because you're focusing on search engine optimization I was getting on to other people's sites in getting <Music/Noise> from other people's brands and I was focusing alot on YouTube and the time as well and yet the podcast The podcast is the number one way that people have found out about me and the stages grown <Music/Noise> I first started out as getting a few thousand down as preface A and again I was I was somebody who had added a podcast on top of their existing brand so is fairly easy for me to start to get initial listeners although I know a lot of listeners who found me through podcasts on I tunes and the other directories here's the thing the stage that <Music/Noise> when you think about if you were to compare contests into an actual real life stage even if you have a couple hundred people listen to every episode that's a significant amount of people cars again real people are on the other enlisting you are a human being right and so if you are to create a podcast and you only have two hundred people listening for example imagine a room full of two hundred people that you're standing in front of an eight K they've come there to see <Music/Noise> and this happens every single week rail that really puts that two hundred people into perspective now the point <Music/Noise> episode gets over one hundred thousand downloads so every week when the episode comes out on Wednesday for Smart passive Income I'm stepping into a stadium with a hundred thousand people who are there who are listening to me and calls part about this is yes it's the equivalent of that but it's even more convenient because <Music/Noise> like to actually set up an event at a stadium every single week and how much that would cost and travel expenses and not not only that the environmental impact it's really important to me but <Music/Noise> you could see the benefits of starting a podcast are amazing <Music/Noise> the exposure in your reach and a kind of impact that your message can have with your audience speaking of ions this brings me to powerful point number two for things that happen as a result of starting a podcast and that is going to have a stronger <Music/Noise> with the audience the bond that you create with your audience through your podcast is unlike any other platform in my opinion it is the number one way to scale into the CIA cannot <Music/Noise> a day because it's msn quote but really the podcast is the most powerful platform for scaling <Music/Noise> because even though you're on <Music/Noise> for me as a content producer as a podcast or it's not just one day one an individual it's one to many and you'll find even in a very short time period that the people who are on the other end of your podcast going to start to feel like you're their friend because you are <Music/Noise> you're speaking to them in a language that they understand because they're listening to because you have great things to offer because your message aligns with their values and all those kinds of things when you start to meet your fans and the people who listen <Music/Noise> the rest are talking t like we've been friends for years even before you <Music/Noise> and I learned about this really quickly because I remember when I was really funny I started my podcast like I said in July two thousand ten and I started publishing an episode only <Music/Noise> weeks I have bi weekly episode and was still blogging three times a week so I was deathly still focused more on the block but I remember going my very first conference after his sermon podcast and the feedback I was getting from people who had learned about <Music/Noise> it was all about it I guess they couldn't stop talking about how great the podcast was and how much they love listening to it and a little story that I was telling on a show nobody was telling me anything about my blogging more now i still continue to block but I deftly doubled down on the podcast after that point because that was the turning point for me to realize wow this show is actually getting to people it's connecting in a way that my blogg is not a double down started publishing weekly have been going weekly ever since I had now have added more podcasts different shows on top of this particular show and a It's been an amazing run it's real cool the listeners remember things that I forgot that I said <Music/Noise> lot a little a lot of the little stories and there's one story I was at social media marketing world <Music/Noise> a cruise on <Music/Noise> in Cabo was coming out of bathroom is women from across the way yells at me and see that your big day me and I was just like what <Music/Noise> I do understand <Music/Noise> a duty Lycoming names and then skate shoe came to me her name is Stephanie saw her nametag and she <Music/Noise> that you <Music/Noise> was so funny when he talked about how you are like a big baby when you're born because I had the baby was <Music/Noise> OK which is common names because I had forgotten that on a very early episode one of a little fun facts that I have the beginning of every episode was the thousand <Music/Noise> twelve ounce baby which was true actually set a record at the hospital in Connecticut where I was born and just to give you <Music/Noise> my mom is only for eleven and so I don't know how that all worked out anyway and I hear talk about geometry or physics or anything like that but <Music/Noise> a really funny story because it just <Music/Noise> this person remember this thing that I forgot that I talked about and it was because that <Music/Noise> fact was something that she connected with because she had a large baby of her own when her son was born and so those kinds of things come out in your podcast and those are things that people remember Pi has a great place to tell stories and share fun things like that and those <Music/Noise> that your audience <Music/Noise> and as a result you will become a friend of theirs much quicker so number two again building a strong relationship with the audience that will absolutely happen right number three the three most powerful thing that can happen as a result of starting a podcast not only are you have a strong relationship with your audience but you'd be able to build strong <Music/Noise> and reap or with other influencers out there because here's the thing about a podcast having a podcast is an amazing platform that allows you to ask people to spend time with you on your show if you were to go to an influence in your space and just call them up and say Hey can I chat with me for thirty minutes take your brain more than likely they're going <Music/Noise> because they value their time it's no fancy it's just their attention is being called for quite often so they're more likely going to say now but if you would approach an influence and <Music/Noise> have a podcast and there are people my <Music/Noise> to hear <Music/Noise> well then there's definitely something in it for them is more likely chance that they can say yes and I think back to a lot <Music/Noise> that I deal with people who are high up in the space I realize that a lot of those relationships started because of my podcast for example Tim Ferris I interviewed him in Episode fifty one and if you listen <Music/Noise> of a fanboy in that episode he was promoting The four Hour Chef that I believe in anyway after a few minutes I got comfortable but that was really cool because I was the first time I got to speak to him my hero Tim Ferris who is really influential for me when I first started out in two thousand with his his book The Four Hour Work Week and I guarantee <Music/Noise> that time with them if it wasn't for the show that I had created same thing with Gary Vann attack when he was coming out with jab jab <Music/Noise> it was a great excuse for me to reach out to him and say Hey I have this podcast I love to feature you <Music/Noise> book with the world and my audience and he deftly said <Music/Noise> only for a short period of time because he is crazy and puzzles and is on a lot of shadows but that's like a little bit of a secret for you guys who want to interview people of today are coming out with something that's typically good time for me to ask them to come on your show because they want to promote something there any more likely in that mode <Music/Noise> to more things other people like Selene <Music/Noise> who's going to show a couple weeks who is now one of my best friends in the space because of the podcast that I created and that time we got to spend together on that show because when <Music/Noise> and you're speaking to them for thirty minutes sometimes an hour <Music/Noise> only naturally <Music/Noise> with them of course if that experience is great for them and you give them some results back and so when you're just <Music/Noise> out can be little more difficult but again reaching out to people who are coming out with stuff and actually starting a relationship with them potentially through social media firsts can have <Music/Noise> likely to say yes when coming on a show those are just little random tips that I share on <Music/Noise> people with their podcast but again the relationships that you can build with influencers first of all you <Music/Noise> like leave a chance to build a relationship with them and you don't approach it like am in a target that influence or because I know that it's going out my brand now you want to target that influence or because you <Music/Noise> with your clients as a byproduct of that relationship will be built I hate when people go into relationships I know this because I've been <Music/Noise> end of this before they want to be my fren because <Music/Noise> they just want something for me now but when somebody <Music/Noise> with me who adds value to me in my life who is just friendly <Music/Noise> I want to give back to them right and so you know make sure that when you approach influencers that you're doing it the legit <Music/Noise> but again having a podcast lousy to have almost excuse but a reason actually for people who want to get to know you and build a friendship with you right powerful thing number four it is an amazing stepping stone the podcast is an <Music/Noise> stepping stone for getting on other stages the stages <Music/Noise> digital stages such is blonde and podcast The podcast The podcast it makes a podcast out there more I comfortable if you go on their show because they <Music/Noise> this deal by guessing he probably have that I <Music/Noise> that's all that stuff but it also helps you in physical stages to the podcast was amazing stepping stone for me to get on a real stage it showed people that I had content that was useful that was shared in a way that was impactful and emotional <Music/Noise> is what people want when they invite people on stage have to give a shout out to PT money or Phillip Taylor from PT many dot com which is a financial blog and he is the founder of The Financial <Music/Noise> Conference fin con which is one of my favorite conferences to go to in two thousand eleven in Schaumburg <Music/Noise> Illinois which is right <Music/Noise> Chicago that's where I spoke the first time thanks to PT <Music/Noise> to my show or had heard that I had a podcast and was confident me actually closing that show closing head closing fin con eleven the very first one I mean there's a lot of pressure on me and I was deathly scared to death and I went back to my roots and started scripting everything <Music/Noise> because I was just so scared that's a whole nother story but actually if you go back to Episode two hundred and thirty you hear that story you actually hear me on stage at that and here just my progression through the world of speaking but I would have started speaking I would have been comfortable speaking it wasn't for the fact that I had gotten comfortable with the podcast New podcast you're <Music/Noise> your true self that's why I feel like also it's more powerful and long because of blood you can hide behind your words you can get things out and make them look perfect you can have somebody else did it right I can't have anybody else be my voice Yes <Music/Noise> at People might seem to help make the show great in terms of quality in terms of removing errors in anything like that yes but it's only <Music/Noise> that can be my voice and so become a little <Music/Noise> you when you become more <Music/Noise> works that works in your favor as so if you ever feel likes speaking is something in your future upon Cass is amazing stepping stone for that not only that this brings me to point number five here on a similar amount podcast is <Music/Noise> to practice communication to become a better communicator if you listen back to my earlier episodes <Music/Noise> even if you remember that audio file I played in the beginning I just did not have confidence as a communicator as a speaker because I had no practice but when you do a number of these podcast episodes become a better speaker you become a better presenter of ideas become a better storyteller and when you tell better stories when you communicate better life just seems to give you <Music/Noise> things and it's not just related to your business in your podcasts in your career too it also has played a role in how I communicate in my personal life with my family with my friends and you can almost hear the progression over time adding <Music/Noise> lot of people in the audience who go back to last episode one or when they first discover SP I go back to let this one <Music/Noise> through I get people who <Music/Noise> do that who binge listen to the show which is another cool thing up I guess people do that I those people the town is it that you've progressed <Music/Noise> as a communicator podcasts in the early <Music/Noise> Gray you can tell you struggle a little bit but now you can tell that you are just more natural and <Music/Noise> I am now coughing behind the microphone I couldn't say that before but I'm also more confident like I said on stage I'm confident in group settings <Music/Noise> a story I am confident when I'm speaking to my kids I'm confident when I'm on another person's show which is really cool and so again making byproduct of starting up I cast is you'll become a better communicator which helps you in all areas of life ok we're closing in on the And here here is the sixth most powerful thing and these are really in any particular order but this is just number six and that is there a lot of monetization <Music/Noise> opportunities that come when you start a podcast actually I want to be upfront and <Music/Noise> that and that is there a monetization opportunities that come about when you become a podcast or when you start a podcast it's very difficult to generate income directly from your podcast on day one now there's many mighty nation opportunities in many ways to do it but if you are going to go down the route of sponsorships and advertising doing that <Music/Noise> very difficult even if you already have a brand even if you always have a podcast that has tens of thousands of listeners and start a new <Music/Noise> it's still difficult to get sponsors for the new <Music/Noise> this because when I started asked Patton twenty fourteen even with tens of thousands of live listeners for every ad is as far as I think about the time advertiser still wanted to see <Music/Noise> for this new show before actually saying yes to sponsorship opportunities and so isn't actually until week six day then was able to report data back into potential advertisers who were interested to then you make a deal for the ASP at podcasting that brings me to the first way that you can potentially generate income to your podcast that through sponsorships and advertising and it doesn't happen right away and you need <Music/Noise> to make it happen but you actually don't need as much as you may think that there are third party programs and third party services <Music/Noise> there that will work with you to find sponsors <Music/Noise> to go <Music/Noise> however you typically need a minimum <Music/Noise> of downloads per month I heard at an event once that minimum number is fifty thousand downloads fear Shelley <Music/Noise> per month not per episode per show per month fifty thousand downloads which is quite a bit and that's very scary in that old and then immediately like cuts out a number of podcast is out there in terms of possibility which is why I feel like going down <Music/Noise> route of you actually personally reaching out to companies that <Music/Noise> that you use and asking them if they would like to sponsor shows much better because the way that the income model works out is it's based on CPM model that's cost per thousand <Music/Noise> if you are a thousand downloads only to pay a <Music/Noise> we only paid a thousand times worth excuse me if you've two thousand <Music/Noise> four thousand double that and so even if you have a significantly <Music/Noise> you can still generate income through sponsorship and advertising because those advertisers only pay you per thousand downloads and as long as they understand they <Music/Noise> that aligns with their product or service or tool or software or whatever then there's a possibility that they want to do that now there are other kinds monetization opportunities as well for example affiliate marketing I feel like if you would ask me pat on the podcast was the quickest and easiest way to generate income would actually be through affiliate marketing and that is promoting or recommending a different person or another company's product or tool or software or service in exchange for a commission if people go through a particular link and so I would do is actually target one particular product or <Music/Noise> thing <Music/Noise> wants hopefully it's something that aligns with something that your already doing that to let <Music/Noise> that you use <Music/Noise> way you can speak honestly about an authentically about it you might <Music/Noise> invite the people who work at that company or the CEO <Music/Noise> of the founder on your shell similar to I did when I've invited Nathan Berry from convert kid on the show or when invited Clay Collins Family <Music/Noise> I mean those <Music/Noise> to provide <Music/Noise> to you because those guys are experts in their fields but also to have <Music/Noise> with them so that when I tell you about the products and give you an affiliate link you're more likely to actually follow through because you've earned that trust or you're more likely to know that that's not something for you depending on how you take in those episodes so having the founder <Music/Noise> a person who represent that company come on your show to talk about that product and the story behind it and be very <Music/Noise> with with your audience make me a great way to get affiliate in common to get and gain people's trust before actually following through on a recommendation that you give physical thing about affiliate marketing products that you don't have to create yourself they already exist of course please <Music/Noise> let people know that there's an affiliate relationship that you're letting your audience now at least <Music/Noise> FTC <Music/Noise> you have to tell people upfront that theirs is a potential exchange of dollars between you and that company so simply saying I have an affiliate relationship with this company Orion a commission when I recommend this product is always really important to do but I always like taking on this approach anyway because some <Music/Noise> that they can generate some extra dollars for you at no extra cost to them through going through your link so I am totally okay with that I would recommend it obviously for legal reasons but I'm not a lawyer just want to get out there but that is something that my lawyer recommended to me as a mini recommend that he was well anyway going back to Philly marking is a product that exists you're probably <Music/Noise> talk about them one other thing you could do was just talk about process and through that process <Music/Noise> be recommending different products for example back in two thousand ten and talked about how I built a security guard training website from scratch and through that process into steps required using certain tools <Music/Noise> the affiliate link for those two along the way in because the part of a process it doesn't become a hard sell it just becomes a natural recommendation because it's something you're already using so that's a quick easy way to go about starting to generate an income because you already <Music/Noise> these products out there in the world that you could recommend you don't have to spend the time actually come up with something or build something they can recommend of course you could"
"14","Smart Passive Income Podcast","274_How_to_Avoid_the_Slimy_Sell_with_Chalene_Johnson.mp3","this is the smart has become podcast with Pat Flynn session number two hundred and seventy four it's time to get to the The Welcome <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> back and <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> inflated <Music/Noise> I turn the what happened here thank you so much for joining <Music/Noise> of the spy passing compiled cast so this coming Monday's <Music/Noise> day in the life of SP eye in the life of my business or a new course coming out there to help use one that's been asked for for so long it was beta tested we put together as a and it's now looking to be available to the public for the first time ever July seventeenth of July twenty fourth my brain a course called Power Up podcasting is there to help you streamline the process of getting your podcast set up and running and launched into setting up I guess but had a lawn chair properly how to market it and then later <Music/Noise> had a star <Music/Noise> those kinds of things and there <Music/Noise> all the way through even get access to me through office hours plus is a community there to help you as well this was of course that day it has <Music/Noise> here's the thing going into this and I'll <Music/Noise> it happened im nt going into this presentation which I knew was going clear pitch at the end I was scared really really scared because I am not somebody who was always very comfortable selling often scared me in I just wasn't very good at the start and <Music/Noise> scared me that's why I had an affiliate marketing for so long and you know people have <Music/Noise> me for courses of all different types I just said no nylon the giveaway a giveaway information <Music/Noise> make money off the affiliate commissions and I soon <Music/Noise> that that's very dangerous thing to do because if you rely specifically and only on affiliate marketing and his <Music/Noise> with those companies could go away for whatever <Music/Noise> there goes your income it's always best to have your own stuff to sell if possible so for <Music/Noise> time I was in affiliate marketing and I've now <Music/Noise> this year actually <Music/Noise> courses and it's been amazing it's been awesome it's been so cool to have something I can confidently sell however this particular time I was creating a course specifically for <Music/Noise> who were very much in need of a podcasting course <Music/Noise> help teach them and it was <Music/Noise> he challenged me to come to her stage at marketing Impact Academy in March of twenty seventeen and sell this brand new product on stage and that is something I <Music/Noise> would do and I'll tell you more about how that <Music/Noise> minute but I will <Music/Noise> that we'll some amazing guests coming <Music/Noise> when he actually challenged me and we talk specifically about the void that's slimy feeling that you get when you sell not had a trick your audience know that's not what is about <Music/Noise> through the products that you have to offer them in the thing is if you don't have confidence in <Music/Noise> if he feels slimy about selling <Music/Noise> know is going to help people will then your audience can feel not very confident in what is it are offering and more than likely not purchase so it's not about being a slime ball it's about how to get over that those feelings of becoming a slime ball when you know that <Music/Noise> something great offer going to talk about that in this episode but I wanted to get back into time actually like we always <Music/Noise> it into the into the <Music/Noise> and take you back to twenty thirty I was invited to speak and events in Chicago and it was where <Music/Noise> marketers are uncommon provide a lot of value to a <Music/Noise> and was really cool is that I got to invite ten people in my audience to come for free and so I did that and was great to meet my fans there and speak on stage but here's the thing I <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> first person speaking was it was one of those events where there's only one stage <Music/Noise> everybody who speaks and the first person was amazing oh my gosh such mind blowing content and all the sudden forty five minutes in the presentation it turned into a pitch fest it was one of the things I just in my head I realize that people were invited for free to go to this event because the organizer was going to make money the back end of it from all the sales and the way that allowed these people were pitching it was just it was just getting under my skin a little bit and to see just the hordes of people get up and spend three four five thousand dollars on things that I just I mean I want to give credit to those people who are selling they did very well and again <Music/Noise> much about them or their product but they had great presentations <Music/Noise> had great pitches but it was just as I just could imagine doing that so actually at that event when I spoke I got up I was the only speaker to not sell anything I think it was just going <Music/Noise> much every speaker was pitching that when I finally got up which was on the last day and I said Hey guys I actually kind of rearrange my presentation to sound like a pitch at the end for something that actually gave away for free and so people actually got up and applauded and so that ingrained in my head that selling <Music/Noise> is bad and so I <Music/Noise> to this event from Saline to go to marketing impact Kevin sellers course I was immediately thinking I was going to become one of those people that I really didn't agree with and it really was a big challenge <Music/Noise> of conversations about this and she really helped my mindset <Music/Noise> idea that I had something amazing to offer and she was clawing at me for help and her audience needed my help and that alone was enough to kind of get me over the edge to actually try this thing out and it was a lot of work done with a presentation to still provide <Music/Noise> if people than purchasing the notes similar to the wet our formula but here's the thing I went up on stage I shared <Music/Noise> I shared about how podcasting can change my life and waited for me I shared a lot of content that I learned <Music/Noise> to the podcasting that I knew was going to be helpful for people no matter what content medium they used and then about an <Music/Noise> had had about two <Music/Noise> available to me about an hour and I started talking about this product in the craziest thing happened when I <Music/Noise> this project was going to be available for this audience is a beta test the power of podcasting I actually got applause in that kind of freaked me out I didn't expect that I I share my story and I reveal that I have this product on offer for people who <Music/Noise> the fast track to de sel and I got applause from the audience in I don't know if it's because the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> was finally coming out of my own products after doing three years but that applause like got me going and got me motivated and then the craziest part was that before <Music/Noise> the price point of that product people were already getting up at their seats because that way it works at these events is you handle forms of people fill out these forms with their information and then they go to the back of the room <Music/Noise> do the transaction to get access to the course later on people are getting anything going in the back even before I mention the price it just it just blew me away and the thing about this event was I was going into it very scared that I knew I was going to sell some and was very scare that I was going to go home after selling a few of these things <Music/Noise> to take a shower just feeling like a sleaze ball and just wanted to <Music/Noise> there's like a clip I remember from a splint or a pet detective where he had just done something <Music/Noise> supposed to and then like it was in the shower naked in the corner like crying like that's how I thought I was going to be and I fell the exact opposite because immediately after I spoke I went to the back of the rim to thank all the new customers and they were thinking me at Thank you so much for this opportunity to get this course Paris <Music/Noise> what <Music/Noise> grateful that you're here thank you so much to take a picture just going with a line of about one hundred and sixty people purchased we took pictures I think than they think me and I got home and I just had to kind of let it <Music/Noise> with what has happened and filigree was that was the most amazing feeling of hand while in terms of what I was doing and selling I felt great selling something and then to see the students go through the course <Music/Noise> have their podcast of an eye teens to leave these amazing testimonials man now I want to do it's more right this is completely change my mindset about selling and it's all about what is your offering and how you offer it's not about tricking your audience and having them believe something that isn't true it's about me you <Music/Noise> that this thing that you have to offer is truly worth what it is that you're sharing and offer that you that you're making like Alex like about this because a lot of the struggle of the sights rather live for years <Music/Noise> very personal at this hour and I can't wait to actually come on who has experience <Music/Noise> great products everything from information <Music/Noise> things to her own products or events those kinds of things so let's not wait any further here she is Selene <Music/Noise> from builder tried this shell <Music/Noise> and Selene Johnson dot com Hey buddy what's up I'm so <Music/Noise> looking back Ilene <Music/Noise> on the show <Music/Noise> a key so much for being here at This <Music/Noise> this is going to be I feel like when the most important episodes that people can listen to and to set this up I want to talk about how <Music/Noise> to be I would say couple years ago and to keep this short I just didn't feel good about selling selling to me was slimy I was making money through affiliate marketing so I didn't feel like I was selling <Music/Noise> essentially offering recommendations based on what I was using but when I got to the point which I realize that I had to sell and we'll talk about why name it I just fell to still be key in slimy <Music/Noise> topic that you're very passionate about Ashley <Music/Noise> actually helped quite a bit to help me break through a lot of mental barriers <Music/Noise> Can you speak on like Why do you think that most people feel this way when it comes to selling things has been taken advantage of before we've all bought things that we felt pressured or gilded or i tricked into buying it so our <Music/Noise> is is on <Music/Noise> that we're going to be taken advantage <Music/Noise> nothing feels worse than being taken advantage <Music/Noise> of and it's not that we <Music/Noise> the audience <Music/Noise> helping some <Music/Noise> something we just don't want to trigger that alarm in someone else I think that's why people feel <Music/Noise> unless of course and his <Music/Noise> must of course you're selling something you don't believe in in which case your guilt is appropriately place let's let's talk about that really cook I think a lot of people that come from places of serving <Music/Noise> to do that and there <Music/Noise> percentage of people who know that they're just scam <Music/Noise> snail a salesman and <Music/Noise> to get into that because I think it's obvious that more maybe just feel guilty because they know that they don't believe in what they're what the weather there offering so it's really important to have that belief that what is that you have to offer is worth a And I know a lot of people who have amazing thing Stauffer who still experience this fear and and and because of it the cell <Music/Noise> but without confidence <Music/Noise> they <Music/Noise> don't get crazy numbers straight razor I have use <Music/Noise> in the past yes <Music/Noise> you feel right when <Music/Noise> offers you something and there you can just tell their own they're not comfortable with it they're not completely confident in what they just offered to you and therefore it affects your confidence if that's the way you feel about the saying you know it the fly can think of is if you ever bought an outfit that is it even at all <Music/Noise> but there's something about this story bought in <Music/Noise> fell you looked in a way to convince you and I believe that they might have thought you look amazing <Music/Noise> you you probably feel better about that outfit and maybe <Music/Noise> and had a lot to do with that person's belief and confidence and opinion of how you look in our bed even <Music/Noise> looks in real life or should I bother us so my point is the way we feel <Music/Noise> we offer to our audience a fax their experience with that thing so if they're already walking into this with confidence with the belief that it's going to help them then the likelihood of them going through with the right attitude and <Music/Noise> outcome is much higher so are really doing our our audience the people that we serve a great disservice by having low confidence that if you say your kids off to school each day you're like yes and her eye school is good for you I think if you balance and stuff you know you've got him pumped up about life or they go <Music/Noise> with an attitude that isn't to serve them right but but I think the act of selling in telling <Music/Noise> something that's right for them and selecting a payment I mean that just scares the crap out of people even if you really <Music/Noise> in what you are offering like how do you connect what you're offering with asking for people to pay money for I think that's really where people are struggling it's a mind set shift now when we started at you <Music/Noise> again I didn't like selling but I was doing affiliate marketing which he said very quickly which <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and so i wun ask u how is crazily <Music/Noise> created if you've created something isn't that your belief you're in a crate that because God help the listeners yesterday and <Music/Noise> diving deeper into this in mind the lack of confidence in the quality that potentially put into something and actually <Music/Noise> that before I listen to an episode on your podcast where you're talking about this kind of on line Africa it was say it was the kind you <Music/Noise> and The Boy and I really <Music/Noise> down with you after listening to that episode because I knew it wasn't them like you let them talk your confidence down you know in that process and when when we had were thinking of the waiters were crazy for people you just have to start and you want to price things so that you feel almost like people are taking the price is so dang good day it is crying that you're offering it to people at this price and the <Music/Noise> is to over <Music/Noise> and upright under prices and that's how I feel it when you know in fact it I would say that this is advice I would give to everyone because I made this a state I've given way too much to people because <Music/Noise> about that like for example our program the marking Impact Academy it is we marketed as being in a week or something like be very transparent right now we marketed as the eight week course it's not it's a sixteen week course is if giving you your business life like we cover everything from developing a business to reaching your target <Music/Noise> to Marcie and every <Music/Noise> media platform to run Facebook as you name it but it's so much that people get all the way through it which means I gotta work extra hard <Music/Noise> people that you need eighty houses go back in right but that's because of my own insecurities in pricing something in <Music/Noise> price range and saying I just I know and maybe in securities but also how I overcome selling a product that's priced at over two thousand dollars I need I need to feel like when I'm saying to my audience you you cannot believe what you're getting for this price you will <Music/Noise> it will give you I need to believe that so much that my face turns red with passion their mom is getting mad at people because and giving them and saving <Music/Noise> them so much money so the one where you can overcome that is number one lower your price to a point which you you really feel passionately <Music/Noise> is such an amazing opportunity for people or deliver more you perfect your product so that you feel so confident when you tell people the opportunity is available to them that people who don't take advantage <Music/Noise> feel bad for them from when wanna just give it away for free because you also want people have skin in the game United notice if if if I give somebody one of my This is great because the platform that we use for Life Academy's actually <Music/Noise> what percentage <Music/Noise> each of my students has watched which is awesome because it's like it's like is if your teacher could actually <Music/Noise> you really <Music/Noise> you copied in and if in fact are studying so I live in I can see exactly how much each one of my students is watching and I can tell you that there's been many instances <Music/Noise> given away product or have even offered one of my products as a bonus for free too you know kind of incentive eyes and to make another purchase that he will <Music/Noise> and people get for free don't freaking do it because <Music/Noise> investment and once I feel <Music/Noise> like some is i swear i swear i'll go through every single lesson please just give me a scholarship and we do it and I always track it because I can't wait for that day when somebody shocks me and actually goes all the way through there's been a few sessions but in general when people don't have <Music/Noise> they don't value what is they've gotten from them I remember <Music/Noise> first started <Music/Noise> about fitness and this was after I had my first skin Haqqani <Music/Noise> but I remember after he was <Music/Noise> working out <Music/Noise> just felt very tired like huffing and puffing up the stairs I needed changing and so <Music/Noise> my friends this <Music/Noise> Hey palette I have <Music/Noise> P ninety x video like Al given you and you could just do and <Music/Noise> that if I had taken his offer I wouldn't <Music/Noise> done the thing I would have gone to that through the daily ritual of getting <Music/Noise> Tony <Music/Noise> I <Music/Noise> that I had to go and pay for in order for me to like you said have skin in the game and actually be motivated to do it so I did and my friends I was crazy like why why would you pay for like it's right here like take it yeah yeah but you're right that's kinda <Music/Noise> important <Music/Noise> that begs the question one How do you know what price to charge well there's a couple different ways you can look at that I will say this I don't believe today we'd be crazy anything on a pad of paper and brainstorming because we have access to what is the most valuable thing in the world when it comes in commercials that is you know a lot of your listeners <Music/Noise> me frown from the infomercials <Music/Noise> I done that show that's on TV right now is called Pio and right <Music/Noise> it's the it's in <Music/Noise> spot for a couple months <Music/Noise> the awesome task a tear I love her but one thing that be you know for the last ten years I learned it from them any day it requires to invest into an infomercial as he can guess how to price things or what your market once <Music/Noise> and at these very expensive and focus groups to figure out like okay so <Music/Noise> that are looking for and what we feel about this Niemann and <Music/Noise> about the pricing <Music/Noise> how would it affect the people's buying <Music/Noise> if that were priced at two payments or one flat payment in what should that Christ may be the average new entrepreneur can afford a ten thousand <Music/Noise> focus to present you as <Music/Noise> for a focus group the way every entrepreneur can do who has even say twenty or thirty followers <Music/Noise> is ask your audience so one thing I recommend people do is before you press it down even guessing which are going to price it off for it as a beta test to a very <Music/Noise> group of your target audience not your best friends not the ones are in a you know say what you want to hear but an audience a very <Music/Noise> and take them through it have them go through your program had intended to have them tell you how it can be improved where they got stuck what they would like more of what they wanted <Music/Noise> everything and then in the end they're doing that in exchange for information and should this be price at how what would you need for this how <Music/Noise> this to you how did this help you how much money <Music/Noise> you and those kinds of things make it so much easier and therefore feels so much more confident about your pricing brainer product because you <Music/Noise> it's actually helping people yes that can <Music/Noise> how many programs we've been able to fix before we <Music/Noise> them and that we've been able to land the right price from the beginning because we use a beta test of a task group and you can charge for a beta test in fact I now one of the things they teach to my own sins as you need to charge for the beta test for people even people won't won't do it even though it's free you've got to church even if it's a lower price if they let people know that this is the beta test price you're getting is deeply discounted price in exchange for information <Music/Noise> I just tested fifteen thousand people to a diet program <Music/Noise> and you know that that was explained the prior year to get this deeply discounted price you're going to the beta testing of this will fix it revise and improve it based on your feet up but we <Music/Noise> your green to do this based on this price they'll give us your feedback and the end of it we send a <Music/Noise> and I ask them everything and the the responses back were priceless please <Music/Noise> like one or two the responses <Music/Noise> a mile away oh my gosh yes it's a it's a calm <Music/Noise> Alex McManus and head when they said was Is Too Much Information I would have paid more if there was last and that's hard for like my ratings while yet as they're just they're too <Music/Noise> we we dial it back and okay so we just continue with what <Music/Noise> more more questions <Music/Noise> what pieces were too much and how <Music/Noise> what's the right amount of content because as we think well if I just give people more I can price it more but if you think about it the most valuable thing in the world people is their time so it's not always that you can price a program has a lot of detail at a higher price point it's what kind of or resulting you deliver in the <Music/Noise> of time possible I love that Coble think <Music/Noise> scoop on that <Music/Noise> I've seen what you've talked about <Music/Noise> that test and on Instagram and action snapped as well that's <Music/Noise> it's a great example the FAA's thank you for that now here's the thing I would say that they said to us was that in some <Music/Noise> where I was teaching kind of in depth content that became a little bit science E B they just flat out told me you watch <Music/Noise> because <Music/Noise> a female and some with the lipstick and wonder <Music/Noise> jewelry <Music/Noise> I five is a kind by I haven't paid <Music/Noise> so <Music/Noise> it tested again and turned those important science based lessons into adios and gotten much better response by interesting season you're putting out work up front but it's to attest to understand a kid how to feel about this and what's working what's not had a price at all this things I think that's really important is not anything that happens overnight but it's definitely worth the process now if I were to ask you Celine going back to this idea of selling and being comfortable in it and I are there strategically ways that are better <Music/Noise> to feel good about selling and how I like give us the good ways to do it yes authentically be something that has helped you and you and help other people with people often say to me so would you be doing five <Music/Noise> and I <Music/Noise> I don't know I don't care but I can tell you this I don't need a plan that I because <Music/Noise> helping people avoid whatever I've just been through or I will be helping people understand whatever challenge I just overcome and the end because <Music/Noise> makes me passionate that's what gives me purpose as it makes me feel like I'm supposed that these weird things happen to us I always believed there this was meant to happen because I meant to help I'm here not for myself I'm here to help other people in and when I serve I feel whole <Music/Noise> it's just an amazing feeling so one of the most important is you can do is look at what your challenges then and if you just tell the story of how you got over <Music/Noise> is or through it or around it were saviors of time or in any tender just the same we would sit down with a friend who's about to go through something you've already done through you feel good about the fact you can save them time money a any stress anxiety heartache and that feels really good start by telling your story and then the next so I was so people just get good at telling the story of how you got the other side <Music/Noise> that the other side it's not time to help people yet Riley you gotta get through it and to have some opportunity that people are looking forward to like the possibility has to be there for others <Music/Noise> and to believe that it's possible for them to love that says that's the that's the point in conversation <Music/Noise> a person might say <Music/Noise> I completely <Music/Noise> the motivations <Music/Noise> is this is awesome is coming from a place of giving <Music/Noise> in from your heart based on situations that you've been <Music/Noise> you've got to <Music/Noise> tell me about the product and so when people come to that point in the conversation does matter where this conversation is happening when you begin to start talking about your products specifically your <Music/Noise> for them I think at that point for a lot of people's <Music/Noise> comes or <Music/Noise> the icky feeling we have to like take a bath afterwards comes <Music/Noise> what's the best way to present your product in a way that's going to make it an honest authentic serving <Music/Noise> as opposed to well <Music/Noise> make you pay for this yes this and <Music/Noise> brought this up because I think is the number one mistake people make when they get to that point is in their <Music/Noise> thinking Oh <Music/Noise> I just tell my story and <Music/Noise> and I think that's the <Music/Noise> look at this and we can tell your voice I've watched people do this their voice <Music/Noise> their demeanor <Music/Noise> they stumble for their <Music/Noise> they get to this point in the sale and to me that someone <Music/Noise> they actually <Music/Noise> switched from serving the selling and if you stay in the mode of serving you won't do this but here's <Music/Noise> to avoid u haf to avoid that script the thing that you think other people want to hear is included or that it gives <Music/Noise> going to do for you or that sets it apart you really have to stay to your own scripts so for me in most cases <Music/Noise> is I'm when I'm in a solace <Music/Noise> and I am offerings into my <Music/Noise> on Facebook and I've done this I done <Music/Noise> kind of infomercial style on Facebook thank you Mark Zuckerberg I just can't thank you enough and like them are <Music/Noise> this for free I can't even <Music/Noise> charging me a yellow <Music/Noise> on facebook and I start by doing <Music/Noise> my formula cook them with the problem see gotta grab them with you know that qualifying question that's not necessarily hook I see <Music/Noise> say is this worth should use in the same tune for the next thirty minutes because of the answer to this question is yes stay it's not keeps growing you know have you as I might say have you been exercising <Music/Noise> into the ground <Music/Noise> just you're pounding <Music/Noise> it feels like working <Music/Noise>"

hadn't set out to measure the size of America's lawn in fact quite the opposite I was working to map the amount of paved area <Music/Noise> States mapping out paved areas included using satellite data measured nighttime light emissions light emission that come from physically turning on streetlights the hand and I She and her team also used aerial photography which of course showed more than just paved areas ye be also took measurements of how much law made a day was and how many shrubs data entry area and that's how they came up with forty point five million acres of turf which is just a bit less than two percent of the United States paved areas meanwhile make up just one point three percent the sheer volume of grass that only thinking how our free loans actually functioning as an ecosystem we use water but also fertilizer and pesticides and then use lawn mower some leaf blowers but their plan so they fought the synthesized absorb carbon what's the balance between will be putting in what we put out and so I decided these would be a worthwhile question to ask the specific question being whether lawns are from a carbon perspective net positive or net negative she began by trying to tally how much water people use on their lawns the standard recommendation especially where rainfall doesn't do the job is one inch of water per week and I am up soo some numbers that they could not believe what were these unbelievable numbers the total was about twenty trillion <Music/Noise> per year on lawn watering one little context for that number consider that we use just thirty trillion gallons to irrigate all our crops next Malays he calculated how much carbon the turf grass stores in the soil and then I subtracted from it and amount of coughing that was SAS is here with an eye to them for deviation and the amount of carbon and was a meet that by using a typical on more and when she learned I danced with her for becoming may sink of carbon and this is not surprising at Planned giving plenty of attention focusing his eyes as carbon but hey it comes to the cost of producing the fertilizer or moaning <Music/Noise> the grass and on the industry that comes around it's even with those costs included lawns look pretty good from carbon perspective on the other hand leaves mottled didn't include inputs like the carbon emissions from the trucks that long cruise drive or the original manufacture of all that lawn care equipment nor did it include the energy used to deliver water to households and clean it for human consumption we should not forget that this is the drinking water I do not account for those costs and has just about any economist will tell you water is often woefully under price which can lead to over use especially for growing grass species that wasn't meant to grow where you live Kentucky bluegrass or creeping bent grass involved in the cool <Music/Noise> climates of northern Europe Ted Steinberg again and if not all that easy to grow them here in the continental United States and especially in the reports of North America if you go to California you'll find still longs with cool season turf press every square foot of that turf grass requires twenty eight gallons of water roughly speaking per year every square foot but that's for the coastal environment if you move inland to a more varied part of California that number increases to thirty seven gallons of water or more per square foot of lawn we waste so much water or city and the mayor of the city of Los Angeles we spoke with our city last year when California was deep in drought in Los Angeles lawns and landscaping use a whopping fifty percent of Los Angeles is water and the drought had doubled with the city was paying to import water so Sadie used incentives to change behavior the city paid residents to install rain barrels to capture water for their lawns to pay them to replace their lawns with drought tolerant plants said if you have a lot <Music/Noise> a crate keep it and pay for the water to water it but if you're not let us pay you to switch that out to beautiful flowering green plants that use a lot less water and were able to do that with over fifty million square feet of lawn just the last couple years we've reduced our water in the face of this trout our water usage by nineteen percent without having to find anybody without having to crack down of the water police but by inspiring people through public education and rebates giving them free sis turns changing out their toilets all the sorts of things what works in California won't necessarily work elsewhere and California is more aggressive than most with environmental regulations for instance is currently pushing to lower emissions on lawn care equipment which tends have particularly dirty little engines are also really noisy uh <Music/Noise> if you just hear the sound of leaf Lord it has these really interesting low frequency and high frequency components Erica Walker she just got her PhD in Environmental Health at Harvard so not only is it traveling inside of your walls but has this high pitched hum that's just really annoying in Boston Walker helped compile a citywide noise report which mapped among other things leaf blower annoyance levels lot of places have banned leaf blowers or restricted hours especially the noisy or gas powered models Walker was interested in the relationship between noise and public health in a city like Boston sleep disturbances I think the the direct relationship between sound and negative half of the World Health Organization suggests that daytime noise levels should exceed fifty five decibels Walker wondered how leaf blowers registered even if you were the one blowing the leaves we see them even <Music/Noise> four hundred feet away from the point of operation you're still getting sound levels there in excess of what the world have Organization recommends for daytime sound levels but then we also learned that this leaf blowers have a strong contribution from the lower frequencies it has an ability to travel very long distances and penetrate through the walls so it's really hard to mitigate hand we see in the epidemiological literature that low frequency sound is creating negative health effects above and beyond high frequency sound the eye in the so what we learned so far we have a lot <Music/Noise> and our pursuit of the perfect lawn is noisy and resource and labor intensive ones do however serve as carbon sinks and of course they're beautiful many people think so and useful for playing for picking for relaxing coming up on his radio we love lawn so much even plant them inside our highways as standard Clover leaf takes up about sixty acres of lawn and if you don't

episode about the costs and benefits of loans mostly because of you occasionally we ask for economics radio listeners for story ideas especially for what we cloak wheelie call our stupid stuff series that is things we do or use or submit to that are on some level kind of stupid last time we ask for your stupid stuff ideas quite a few of them concerned lawns Pat Allen Trinity Florida row what is up with the American addiction to lawns John Faulkner of Arlington Virginia complained about noisy smelly <Music/Noise> and then there was Alan Turner from New Castle Delaware my formal training initial career was in landscape architecture in right now I'm looking the highway <Music/Noise> at the rest stop on I ninety five just south of Wilmington Delaware Turner's pet peeve is what's in that highway dress and it looks like this grass gets mowed three times in the summer let's say it's not just in highway medians but also those Clover leaf interchange is a standard Clover leaf takes up about sixteen acres of lawn Turner understands why these are all grass grass is cheap grass is the cheapest ground cover you can install the problem with grasses that is also the most expensive ground cover to maintain and it has to be maintained mode especially for safety for good sight lines so you've got all that knowing and all those traffic delays on the mowers are out there in the medians Turner's ideas to plant highway medians with plants that don't require me it's like grass does the seed might cost slightly more but that's the only difference and then you get a permanent ground cover that needs knowing I can honestly say this the first time <Music/Noise> to talk to anybody about roadside vegetation management Doug he cocks with the Federal Highway Administration which advises states on how to maintain their highway grass nobody asked us about plants they ask us about traffic and potholes I think conservatively we've got about seventeen million acres of roadside vegetation roadside grass think back to the early days of auto travel having a grassy area near the road in case somebody broke down for one to just rest after this ordeal of driving around was a very tempting option so that's what began and as time went on grass sort of became an expectation because everywhere <Music/Noise> there was and when you didn't have it people noticed that was the prevailing attitude we want these roads to look inviting we want them to look like your front yard that begin to change as early as the nineteen sixties state and local governments realize how many resources went toward maintaining all that grass and in the seventies and eighties we began to realize the water was really big issue in states dealing with tight budgets began to plant native grasses things are a little bit more water efficient and dresses that didn't require as much mowing still about Alan Turner's idea to get rid of grass entirely in favor of something that requires no mowing I think he does have a point however I'm also not willing to say that states haven't already considered that there may be reasons why they have to plan what they have budgets are so tight at the State UT level ok not replanting but also just not mowing the grass at all if you were to let something just go wild return to nature that sounds great it sounds easy it sounds cheap and it is it's not necessarily the best choice though that's for the invasive species thrive and that becomes a little habitat for like in the south you've got kudzu that grows all over the place and you've got other kinds of invasive species that pop up and start to proliferate invading local neighborhood lawns or farmer's crop to can get out of control I totally understand he's saying and that's the assumption that is Sarah Wigginton but I think we have to look and see if what we assume is really what's gonna happen and that's basically what we decided to do she's an ecologist working on her PhD at the University of Rhode Island ecological research focuses on finding creative solutions to human caused environmental issues she and her colleagues had a question about invasive species the question that we were trying to answer was If invasive species actually do proliferate in roads areas that are taken out of the regular <Music/Noise> strategies that took advantage of the sort of natural experiment in Rhode Island the Department of Transportation typically Moses roadsides anywhere from three to ten times a year but over the past decade it decided to reduce mowing in some areas and stop entirely in others we classify that as passive restoration because you're just taking it out of the milling circulation and then letting it go letting in succession take course this litte Wigginton and her colleagues compare the number of invasive plant species in the mode areas versus the un mowed which had begun to grow wild they also that the young forests nearby which had never been mowed how did they collect those data it sound not super glamorous we basically lay out really long tape using compass is to make you know straight angles and then a very very time consuming process we document every single species that we see and these subplots what they find we found that invasive species are not proliferating significantly in these areas that are taken out of the traditional knowing scheme they have the same number of invasive as both the young forests and the traditional <Music/Noise> so Al would advise that its state D O T's move as much of their land as is reasonable to a reduced or low <Music/Noise> scheme well I think the easiest thing to do is to elect to have what I call low maintenance lawn Ted Steinberg again he is talking about personal loans now highway medians over treatment is the single biggest problem we have here in the United States with respect to lawn care so right away scale back on the chemical applications you can get away with three applications of fertilizer per season people also probably need to actually learn a little bit about the ecology of their yard to do it right you probably should get a soil test on a big deal leave the clippings on the lawn for god sakes don't put him out on the curb because the clippings break down and they return nutrients to the soil and I would argue consider stopping the irrigation Brown's not so bad though I think you just lost a lot of our lawn loving audience read and think that's that's too bad I'm not saying I disagree with you into saying that I think people think of a <Music/Noise> Brown is death Brown is the enemy Brown is not a law on the next time your lawn if you're worried about this it turns brown go out there get down on your hands and knees and look at the at the grass it's not dead most of them in a horrible drought ok I get it okay but if it's not when it appears to be brown is actually dormant and you'll see a little bit of green where the blade meets the soil the individual plants most of them are still alive Ted I think even you would have to admit that if you got your way and if America suddenly woke up and said you know of and <Music/Noise> lawn is good enough makes lot of sense aesthetically it's fine environmentally it's probably better noise wise it's etc but think of the jobs you're killing I mean this is a pretty substantial part of the labor market especially for low education workers are you Ted Steinberg fests of history in law willing to take the key for killing off all those jobs I think one of the big problems that we have in the United States today maybe even in the world is a lack of meaningful employment but actually it might not be as dire as you're implying here you're still going to need people to mow lawn maybe not as much you don't really need necessarily them for your lawn once a week so this could represent a savings obviously to consumers and it might not be the case that the floors go in for the job market because Ted Steinberg advocates for less in the way of perfection and lawn care <Music/Noise> is also the possibility of repurposing your yard entirely maybe tennis court or an outdoor library or taking a page from our past Jim Bunning Steve and Terry Oh good I Steven and Jim Jim coalesce key is the front yard farmer in New Port Richey Florida A small city just outside Tampa so let me ask you this you came up in lawn care and enjoy that work you know <Music/Noise> thought I did um <Music/Noise> every time I see a line trailer I did she ever seen what it's like tear I don't know if I didn't and you know I I had these so many chemicals especially in and you know as I came to Florida and the lines they got here they got kinds of grass they will not grow without pesticides and herbicides you can get him to do anything <Music/Noise> vegetables and fruit are a different story to grow sweet potatoes and black eyed peas star fruit and avocados lettuce and broccoli and cabbage and cauliflower coalesce key turn the front yard into productive farmland he started with his own yard then expanded to his mom's house down the street next life just buy a house right next door to her three years ago after a mere front yard which is full sun so it's allowed me to have a lot more growing space he sells his produce at local farmer's market I think the best year I had a late two thousand tons of sleep de but theoretically if I get better at this this should be produced in like fifteen thousand pounds I cannot believe how much value can come out of a small piece of land of Alaska gardens all winter in Florida then he drives his nineteen sixty five cherry red pickup truck to mean does the same thing in both places he's known for his salad mix the color Green Zone X and I kind of plant very diverse like it could be <Music/Noise> different leafy greens unable to garden next it as a packet and I wash and spin and put in a bag and sell that <Music/Noise> I'll sell you in Florida probably sell for two thousand twenty five hundred of those bags <Music/Noise> is pretty much the same next thing you know maybe a thousand out there and I don't is a shorter season it's not as populated so I make more of my money in Florida for Cher say how much money to make you know I'm doing <Music/Noise> know I do keep track because I want to show people how much you can make this pudding with a cash business I can hide stuff but I haven't kept track for the last three years are two years really good sell I think first year that kept the attack was like twenty four grand <Music/Noise> twenty seven died down my pace of like thirty five this year I have very little expenses so you know thirty five grants a lot of money I don't know where to spend actually get any help for now it's just you know you know and I've been on kind of a fuss budget and <Music/Noise> I've I've I've learned and you know it's more stressful for me to try to work with other people and make things happen is more my focus is to see how productive a small piece of land can be an unseen that every year and getting better at it are there or were there any legal issues or ordinances you had to deal with to plant a garden in a front yard there you know we're fortunate here because you know it isn't ninety just checked the community so there's not much for <Music/Noise> and there's nothing against a lot to do this I mean potentially there could be some unforeseen issues about the height of vegetation but its always look so good that was never an issue say you sound like a pretty live and let live kind of guy but on the other hand it sounds like you would be pretty happy if you started the front yard garden Revolution yeah I would die when you think I'd be one to lead something like that but I've found that you know people follow things that work I haven't done any promotion over this ten years that there's been a lot of press and then amazed at how people are just longing for this and you know I think it's poised to take and sell you know potentially we can put people back to work on the land I farm in every yard that is hardly the direction our economy's been moving in either the agricultural economy <Music/Noise> care economy but who's to say the rise of the lawn was probably not foreseen would ever turn to personal farming be any more surprising that's it for free time trader this week coming up next time Steve Helton was for years the man behind and beside British Prime Minister David Cameron we have been in touch since the break to vote I think there's not much to say beyond that now Hilton lives in America was taken up a new crusade we want to and the the way that big money donors dominate politics and Wilhelm is nearly unknown here that won't last for long he's got a new show on Fox News called the next revolution and that is going to focus on what I'm calling positive populism how we deal with the issues that have arisen as a result of the populist uprisings we've seen around <Music/Noise> Steve Hilton in all his candid occasionally absurd glory that's right it's next time on Freakonomics Radio <Music/Noise> Radio is produced by WIC

to the story of a man who's quite famous in his native England Steve Helton you've talked about democracy malfunctioning rose from humble immigrant beginnings to join the elite faction these fancy people who became close friends with and ultimately senior advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron I basically was responsible for the implementation of our domestic policy reform program a man who became disillusioned with his position what typically happens in government is the exact opposite of how things should work who became disillusioned with his boss wanted him to make this piece and he always agrees that yes good idea will do to whomever made that speech and who after two years in ten Downing Street left his job looking back on it because I will do my job properly he de camped to California with his family and really have anything planned for my next move but now he's found a new political mission and the way the big money donors dominate politics its mission that includes a new TV talk show I'd love to have the Saudis and the truck to get how amazing would that it's the story <Music/Noise> who sided against his old friend and boss in the biggest vote of all what we have been in touch since the break to vote so I think there's not much to say beyond that a man whose life has regularly intersected with unwanted attention getting very Daily Mail at this point I think I am not sure this is the tone of the conversation that we should be having that avid anyway Steve help the most famous political operative in America that no one in America knows yet at least <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the The The The <Music/Noise> when David Cameron became prime minister of the United Kingdom in two thousand and ten his administration adopted two primary missions Number one in drag Britain out of the worst economic ditch since the Great Depression and number to change what his conservative party and really all of government change what it stood for especially in its interactions with actual people this fiscal mission was largely the purview of George Osborne Cameron's Chancellor of the Exchequer and it was Steve Hill and iconoclastic former ad man who steered mission number two essentially wanted to de centralized central government from within central government some of his wishes were in line with what Americans think of as conservatism fewer regulations than top down government directives reforming welfare and privatizing some public services but on social issues and things like energy in the environment Hilton like David Cameron was oppressive the implicit promise smarter smaller government with cleaner greener in kinder results a very You can have it all package alas much of Britain's having none of it either within Whitehall or beyond the camera administration had its share of victories but it was seen as veering between New Age spin doctoring and old fashioned government tone deafness in the press Steve Helton took a lot of that he was portrayed as the rescue and a true believer in lost causes after just two years in office he took with Downing Street called a one year sabbatical but it became permanent peace in the economist lamented his departure it praised Hilton's efforts to quote open up Britain's Napoleonic state to people power the I found it massively intensely frustrating most of the time and this is where I reflect on the I think that most of that was my fault in the sense that I approached it in exactly the wrong way to understand what Hilton now considers the right way we should start at the beginning of my pairs Hungarian my father right you've also a man many years ago but he was mentioning about him was he was the goalkeeper for the Hungarian national oh yes he was a big sports are hungry and he met my mom actually in the UK but they split up and my stepfather is also Hungarian so my whole family background is from Hungary and the year <Music/Noise> for your step father your father Hilton comes from her seconds at his check yes very good research going on yes we tried but that's your biological father's name your stepfather them to secure in my biological father's name and they made easy to say by picking Hilton and I understand that apocryphal that the name was chosen for the first hotel that they stayed at yes yes that's not true I would say you grew up in London area then you have the first real trip into town to brighten the south coast of England ok so to talk about growing up there and then your schooling understand you did very well at an earlier level won a scholarship to very good school yeah it's an amazing school that you cook rice hospital it's a charity and most of the kids that don't pay any fees that is a charitable foundation and in fact all selected on the basis of some kind of social needs from inner city areas of various kinds actually it's really weird just because it's a boarding school in the middle of the English countryside as far removed as you can imagine from the inner city and its incredible incredibly diverse kids you know from all different backgrounds and races and colors all just makes the other wearing is very We had uniform that dates back to the sixteenth century it's just totally bizarre you went on to Oxford which lets say was probably a little bit less diverse but I tell you what was diverse from me about it was the I met Rich People for the first time and that was really interesting the the at Oxford Hilton enrolled in the famous P P E program philosophy politics and economics the foundation of many political careers indeed future Conservative Party heavyweights David Cameron and Boris Johnson were there a few years ahead of Hilton but he didn't meet them there here's how he got involved in the Conservative Party one summer during university he had such a boring job shuffling around insurance files that he applied for a different job he saw advertised on TV in the UK you don't have political advertising of this is the party political broadcasts with a political body get free air time on the main channels are images of catching one and at the end those very posh guy who's the chairman of the cans of fosters remember him saying at the end of reward to help conserve body right to me Peter Brook I really remember was being about thirty is the right to me Peter Brook and conservatives you know it may be to have some interesting jobs and that's how I go in to that was completely accidental I see so this was the Conservative Central Office it's called that right yeah I think they now call it something as Conservative headquarters though is the party headquarters ok so you basically land this job via the equivalent of what we would think of here's the advertisement on a Mac truck right in that job you meet David Cameron the future prime minister in your future colleague and boss and your future wife Rachel what stones that right Yeah and then there would be many many entanglements among them the fact that you and Rachel eventually would become Godfather to his in his wife's first child who tragically died very young yet David Cameron would become Godfather to one of your children if I have it right that's right and there are other entanglements along the way including before you're married that your future wife had an affair with David Cameron's father in law I'm getting this rate is well yeah getting very Daily Mail at this point I think yeah I'm not sure this is the um the tone of the conversation that we should be having now she comes from what sounds to be an interesting family her parents were involved in politics I understand that Milton Friedman and if a high act would have dinner at her parents' home if that's true but I'm curious to know a little bit more about her background I think that is true yeah her grandfather who was going to be shot for getting this wrong but I think this is I think the stories that he was a refuse pile in the SEC more worn came back and I was a business but I think he was the person that brought sort of industrialized chicken farming to the UK something like that idea of having seen in America interesting and you know keep chickens in your back yes you all know you've de industrialized the chicken process I got the and he think this is what he read high IQs famous book The Road to surf them I was inspired by it and that book argues that the basically that the measures that were undertaken to win the war in the centralization of the economy and that in the growth of government would inexorably lead to the enslavement of society and that the growth of big government had to be checked so did Rachel grow as <Music/Noise> or is he what he went to see high at that time I think was teaching at the NSE them School of Economics and said I read your book I think is great I will help put these ideas into practise I'm going to run for parliament as a Conservative MP and Hyatt said to him if you really want to change things don't do that because the first thing you have to use when the battle of ideas so don't go into Parliament them better use of your time and money if it would be to set up a think tank so that's exactly what he did and so Rachel's grandfather set up the Institute of Economic Affairs which became the kind of powerhouse think tank for free market thinking in the UK energy around the world and really incubators love the idea is that the mobile Thatcher adopted and implemented as promised the the the Even though Hilton is talking here about his wife's grandfather he could be talking about himself he has come to believe that industrialization and institutional of them especially as they intersect with government are essentially a drag on humankind he recently wrote a book about this is called more human we have designed and built a world that is in human rights in governments the world over political leaders preside frustrated and impotent over vast bureaucratic system that routinely disappoint and leave citizens enraged that they can't control what affects their lives can complain that our food our education our health care are quote provided by anonymous distant industrialized machines now how did he come to hold these views straight out of college I worked at the Conservative Party that was just a couple of years and then I left and worked at an ad agency Saatchi Saatchi where most other things business basically an also did a lot of elections and public advocacy campaigns around the world including in anti racism campaign in the UK they then gave me the idea for my next move which was to start a company called good business which was a corporate responsibility consulting firm that lasted another seven or eight years and then we worked for some of the biggest companies in the world trying to advise them how to improve the social environmental impact and that intersection between business and social and community issues environmental issues I think that really informed a lot of what I then try to bring to the project of modernizing the British Conservative Party Hilton's re entry into conservative politics came in two thousand Fife he wanted to run for parliament but lost out in the selection process he was however offered a job by his old friend David Cameron now his late thirties Cameron was a member of parliament with designs on being elected leader of the Conservative Party and we're around this really great in surging campaign where his body was based on his character and his optimism and sense that you could put together a positive account of water more conserved is more to represent in the modern age really understanding the problems of today but a plank and service solutions Cameron won that contest and of course the larger one five years later to serve as prime minister Hilton was central to these victories and became perhaps even more central once Cameron moved into Downing Street the the you personally Steve Helton became known at least in the media as a figure that's really not not not so uncommon in American politics as well but maybe more pronounced you were considered brilliant occasionally devious plenty of enemies you spoke your mind you you did not stand on protocol you like to not wear shoes you like to not dress up the way that most government officials and aides typically dress up and behave and you seem to have a kind of I mean this is some positive kind of ruthlessness for accomplishing an agenda talk about what those first couple years being in the administration were like what you felt was going <Music/Noise> what you felt wasn't going well what I think that what went well was the leadership that David Cameron particularly provided in terms of stabilizing the economy and basically I think that at the time he took office the other country ready die predicament and people are incredibly anxious about what would happen pretty quickly he established the sense of orderly calm of the situation and I think achieved in the way his main goal which is which is to give the country kind of responsible stewardship I think that's that's what he mainly saw the job as being anti absolutely delivered on that did you enjoy those first couple years I should choose choose to put enjoys incredibly hard work incredibly frustrating is an amazing provision that says sounds like a bit of a cliche but it really is just to have the opportunity to work on problems that the real and try make a difference in people's lives I think one of the best actually was something that we introduced with national citizen service in the idea that was a kind of non military national service for teenage is to try and create a sense of community cohesion and social mixing and bring people together from different backgrounds and also to be the possible development that's a specific thing where I can say you know what that really was something I'd conceive with David Cameron right to the beginning and soared to its implementation SOC very rewarding and the National Citizen Service was the quintessential Hilton idea that is government using its leverage to throw some organizational mojo back to its citizenry was part of a grand vision he came to call Big Society the argument went like this previous Conservative Party leaders had said you know the enemy is big government and we need to cut back government to roll back the front is of the state cut back the size of government cut spending and everything will be great and that certainly had its appeal particularly in the UK in the the end of the nineteen seventies when people feel that the state really had got way too big an out of control but as you went through the eighties people so that actually if you just cut back government and left it that people were often left behind and social problems were addressed and so we tried to make more nuanced argument than just saying smaller government we say yes we want the answer to all problems is not Big Government Big Society David Cameron fully embraced the idea the idea of the Big Society is trying to help individuals and communities and policy is to come together and find solutions to the problems that we have just a big idea is that you're looking for Big Society announces Rob and Big State oats is among the cornerstones of big society more power to local communities and institutions including government and police more volunteerism and support for all kinds of co ops and social enterprises also a push to make government radically transparent by publishing more data on paper and in Steve Helms mind the phrase Big Society was a winner but to the opposition and the press it was a touch too Orwellian and then it became the subject of political argument back and forth perception wasn't the only issue there was also the need to execute what typically happens in government is the exact opposite of how things should work instead of starting with real people and then needs and understanding <Music/Noise> work and putting together programs that are in touch with that and what with that you go in you're in a hurry on to make change happen you just sitting at the center and office with the leaves of pounds was a steamroller way through and actually that usually ends in massive waste of money and disappointing outcomes and that is the story of every government it seems to me regardless of their political persuasions on is a lot to learn Hilton came to be seen as a bit of a hypocrite talking up power to the people from within the ultimate core of power it didn't help that he usually kept himself way out of public view so that if it was a time when you know it seems are shadowy we IT advisor unit rescued and that's all that kind of stuff was written and I think that during that time there was a lot of misunderstanding and particularly I tell you I think you know there's a trail of me on one of these TV shows to come and that the thick of it yeah what it was the thick of it I spent ten years detox find this party by renovating an old <Music/Noise> house to eat in take out the sexes being here callous window that replace the old homophobic reef style but after awhile you realize that this renovation is doomed because the foundations are built on what I can only describe as a Sony but of the yet exactly what he was funny and you know I get in my loft but the thing that was with his reserve wrong about that was the characters just was entirely focused on personal presentation and how things are going and actually I think for a long time that was how I was sort of scene rather than at you I really care about substance and policy exactly the among the policies that he cared about most whether Britain would stay part of the European Union coming up on economics radio is harsh difference with Cameron on that issue eyesore breaks is an opportunity for the UK to be a really dynamic open pro enterprise country engaged with the whole world also we learn the unlikely sight of Hilton's political re awakening of the school D stands for the design we find out what he's up to these days and how his new TV

political tech startup based in California and I'm also the host of a new show on Fox News on Sunday evenings cool the next revolution and that is a show that is going to focus on what I'm calling positive populism how we deal with the issues that have arisen as a result of the populist uprisings we've seen around <Music/Noise> particularly in the UK with breaks in here in America with Trump's election in a positive way talking to help you begin to sense that these populist views on government aren't so different from his own views although he has really intensified while serving in Downing Street the U left Number ten after a couple years moved to California with your family according to The Washington Post At least you left Downing Street quo after becoming disillusioned with Cameron's progress and the lack of boldness no idea if that's sure not want you tell us I mean the immediate reason was was a family one in the sense that which my wife she's head of government relations and pee off of Google and she was committing a lot basically to put under the California which is pretty tough and what our second son was born I just got ready so we decided to move that was the immediate reason but frankly I I think that description then that you read out is is correct but if I look back on it I think that he really is it was my fault in the sense that I hadn't really figured out how to deliver for David Cameron the kind of revolution that we had promised and to actually do that in a way that worked with the institutions of the bureaucracy that we inherited rather than just sort of relentlessly attacked them and I think that that's my full so I deeply felt decision to the time and his wife Rachel wet stone had been a very high profile power couple in England in California not so much I mean that's not love I love California thing is just the best place in the world what Stone was Head of Communications and Public Policy Google for several years and left for a similar position at labor but she left that job quite abruptly and it was revealed soon after that British watchdog agency was investigating whether old friend David Cameron had improperly lobbied on Cooper's behalf Hilton meanwhile had met some people at Stanford and from that rose the opportunity to teach them various parts of the university and most importantly at the school that the school the D stands for design is the Institute of Design at Stanford and that really was for me a transformational experience transformational but also bittersweet if I'd had the benefit of the experience before I had the privilege of working government I think I would have been a hundred times more effective because if we adopted Indian government was taught as a human centered design or design thinking it's really simple you start any project with an intense focus on the user who are you designing for who is supposed to benefit from this and that is really on the sound their lives then you generate some ideas and if we do anything you test them out you turn them into a very cheap prototype that enables you to get feedback before you go to the expense of building anything or if the palace and government if we actually start spending real money on implementing a program yet she tested out with people get reactions and the process of rapid low cost prototyping and testing is totally absent from the way government operates and if that was present I really believe you would save so much wasted money and have so much more effective government programs I guess where the parallel between let's say designing consumer products and designing policy seems to break down as the following When your firm trying to come up with the right product for your consumers your eventual consumers you can do that kind of you know in your garage without a lot of scrutiny when you're doing it in government you have intense and constant scrutiny both from the opposition party or parties and the media which makes it harder to do things like rapid prototyping and experimenting because you're always <Music/Noise> about you know the Redux Div form of your idea getting released to the media and being ridiculed or being shot down by someone else to talk to me from in a bow whether you really think that model can work as well in society and politics as it can for something like designing whether it's user experiences for companies like uber or Google to firm your wife has worked for or or something else government can do this can really start to work out how better to address some of these problems in very very small and low key way the tree with a couple of hundred people you need to spend a fortune on some big pilot program is announced in the media and then scrutinized but as another point I want to make which is you're so right about this the way that the media climate which is inevitable by the way I'm not complaining about it is just a fact of life means that politicians and government officials really risk of us when it comes to trying to bring for innovations or even let experiments happened that you can learn from and one of the things that really needs to happen is to try and change the culture arm of the week we tried for years in the run up to the twenty ten general election we try to persuade David Cameron to make a speech where he would explicitly say he is our agenda for reform it includes trying lots of new things out innovations that will bring for new ways of dealing with problems inevitably when we do that things will go wrong there will be failures as well as successes week on God and we wanted to make the speech to set up the fact and to give us some space for that kind of experimentation and he always agrees yes good idea will do it"

and click be on the show TMS idk dot com also tell you everything you need to know about the podcast upcoming live dates to hear from you <Music/Noise> the I remember standing in my kitchen cooking dinner for my son I just we just burst out laughing you know it was the family this joyful thought of is it crazy that nature has come up with this incredible little machine the history of science is full of accidental discoveries penicillin perhaps most famously but also gunpowder and nuclear fission make sense does not because you don't know what you don't know you don't always know what you're looking for her at sometimes you've just got a curious mind so the research project that led to this technology was really a you know it was a curiosity driven project Jennifer Dowd is a professor of chemistry and biology at the University of California Berkeley and I've had a longtime interest in understanding the fundamental biology in particular aspects of a genetic control and the way that evolution has come up with creative ways to regulate the expression of information in cells when you first heard literally heard the phrase crisp air just describe that moment what your understanding of it was and what you kind of initially envisioned it facilitating well when I first heard the acronym crisper this was from a conversation with Jill Banfield IAEA had no idea that was this was in two thousand and six Banfield also a Berkeley scientists have been studying bacteria that grow in toxic environments so she was looking at bugs that grow in old mine shafts and you know these pools of water that filled up in old mines that are often very acidic or they have various kinds of metallic contaminants to figure out what bugs are growing there and how are they surviving the key to their survival was cold crisp or clustered regularly enter space to shore Palin drew MC repeats say that five times fast Banfield thaw the bacteria have developed a sort of pattern based immune system to protect themselves but exactly how it worked was a puzzle to help solve it she recruited Dowd and we ended up spending several afternoons where Jill was showing me her DNA sequencing data from bacteria and you know explaining what these sequences work began as a casual conversation about an obscure subject grew to consume data for years finally she had a breakthrough we just burst out laughing today I'm free comics radio the mind blowing discovery already changing medicine and more a remarkable gene editing tool called crisper that's right I said gene editing the implications of that boundless change wasn't telling the story I feel its chill in my body and if you think the genetic revolution is still years away think again the technology for that is here now the <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the the the the congratulations on your future Nobel Prize and <Music/Noise> Jennifer Dowd hasn't won the Nobel prize yet but it's hard to imagine she won't go back to when she started working with Jill Banfield learned that Christopher's were DNA sequences stored in the cells bacteria you can think about it like a genetic vaccination card it's a way that sells store information in the form of DNA from viruses to use in the future to protect cells if that virus did show up again in the cell had a work in what might it mean if scientists can figure it out in two thousand eleven having already studied crisper for a few years it ended microbiology conference in Puerto Rico there she met a man U L Sharp Antti a then a researcher at Mel University in Sweden sharp Auntie A was researching a mystery protein that she felt was the key to crisper she and Dowd began a long running collaboration we were working together to understand the molecular basis other words what are the molecules that allow bacteria to find and destroy viral DNA that was the question that we set out to address and in the course of that research and in the course of that research we figured out that a particular protein has a name Cass nine is programmable by the cell protein that can be programmed to fight viruses you can start to see where this is going the amazing thing that this CAS nine protein does is it works like a pair of scissors it literally grabs on to the DNA and cuts it at that place at that precise place the thought of nature could program this CAS nine protein to precisely at DNA why can they it turns out that when this is transplanted into animal or plant cells are human cells it's possible to introduce changes to the DNA very precisely and that's how the technology fundamentally works then came the night at home cooking dinner for son when she burst out in joyful laughter at the sheer wonder and the mass of possibilities is it crazy that nature has come up with this incredible little machine so so there was that third moment and then I think that sort of morphed into a growing recognition that you know this technology was going to be very impactful in many different areas of science dao de together with sharp on today in several other colleagues wrote up their research and on June eighth two thousand and twelve formally submitted to the journal Science was published twenty days later suddenly the world knew that the crisper Cass nine system could be harnessed as a new gene editing tool a new kind of genetic engineering is revolutionizing scientific research scientists think Chris Burke could launch a new era in Biology and Medicine Chris Burr could help rid us of diseases like cystic fibrosis muscular Dystrophy and even HIV and cancer Jennifer Dowd has spent her career largely cloistered in laboratories she didn't have a high profile background I grew up in a small town <Music/Noise> suddenly she was a scientific super hero weeks for those questions with Jennifer Dowd have a doubt that Jennifer Dowd Jennifer doubt the ancient bacteria immune system as a powerful gene editing technology breakthrough Prize is awarded to a manual shop on T A and Jennifer doubt no doubt has spent the past few years racing forward while also trying to slow things down she wrestles with all this in a book she co wrote with another crisper researcher Samuel Sternberg it's called a crack in creation <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the title refers to what well and it scores the crisper gene editing technology is is now giving human beings the opportunity to change the course of evolution and you know human beings have been affecting evolution in for a long time rate I think now there's a technology that allows a very specific changes to be made to DNA that gives us a new level of control and so you know it sort of opening a crack and I sort of see it is like analogous to opening a door to the future that is really you know a change in the way that we think about our world as opposed to like a crack in the dimension that we will fall through and all disappear not that kind of crack I wheeled the former not the latter yeah okay so as you are in the book we uncovered the workings of an incredible molecular machine that could slice apart viral DNA with exquisite precision so when you call an incredible molecular machine your breakthrough of you and your colleagues essentially an external human guided replica of what already exists or are you kind of taking over the controls of what inherently exists this is important we are really taking over the controls of what already exists and were doing it by using this bacterial system the cast line protein to find and make a cut in DNA in but say human cells at a particular place where the cells natural repair machinery can then take over and do the actual editing what's amazing to me is the natural repair machinery obviously exists and maybe it works really well a lot of the time just in the most drastic circumstances like a cancer or a debilitating disease that doesn't mean the healing mechanism from reading what you've written it sounds as though it's quite stick ass think it's random unpredictable some things that catches something that doesn't sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't so can you talk about the big picture of this repair mechanism and how well or poorly it does sure so DNA repair happens all the time in cells and as you eluded to it has to work right most of the time <Music/Noise> would probably not be here or we will have a lot more cancer than we have and so we know that at that sells experience double stranded breaks to their DNA <Music/Noise> were routinely and that they have ways of fixing those breaks and so I would say that what this crisp or technology does is it really taps into that natural repair pathway The <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> tenth the announcement of the crisper Cass nine technology the scientists around the world exploring possibilities in many different arenas let's start with plants <Music/Noise> I think it's important for people to appreciate that you know for Saul that humans have been modifying plants for a long time no genetically and young for this literally thousands of years exactly thank goodness right and you realize Wow I'm glad there's that I'm glad there's light reading but you know the way that's been done traditionally is to use chemicals or even <Music/Noise> to introduce the genetic changes into seeds and then plant breeders will select first for plants that have traits that they wanted of course can imagine when you do something like that you drag along a lot of traits that you probably don't want and you know change is the DNA that you you don't even control for right so you don't <Music/Noise> what they might be doing and so I think the opportunity here with gene editing in plants is to be able to make changes precisely so not to drag along traits that you don't want but to be able to make changes that will be beneficial to plants but to do that very precisely and then we have the opportunity to do things like you know give plants the ability to grow with much less water or to defend themselves against various kinds of infections and no pests that are moving and do climate change I think from the perspective of the world food supply that's going to be extremely important going forward and will potentially allow us to have access to plants that are going to be much better adapted for particular environments and to grow we hope without chemical interventions of different types know given how nervous some portion of the population is about the phrase genetically modified organisms even though as you point out almost every organism on earth has been genetically modified for you know hundreds if not thousands of years this feels like a next level step that will raise all kinds of questions even the plant world forget about humans or animals yet no governance and autonomy and so on what are your thoughts on that in the in the plan to slash agricultural world I think that you know it's really going to come down to people having access to information about where is our food coming from so that people in different countries can evaluate these plants in the technologies used to create them and make their own decisions about what they want to do and having a precision tool that allows us to generating plants that are better let's say adapted to particular environments are you know maybe have even better nutritional value and I I really believe that going forward that we can afford to reject this we really have to understand it and you know regulated appropriately but we do have to I think we have to have this to our tool box <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> crisper gene editing is also being put to use on animals scientists in China are engaged in controversial research genetically modifying beagles to be more muscular these mosquitoes have been genetically modified to preach with and eliminate that these pieces in an urgent attempt to <Music/Noise> of dengue a few researchers believe that they can recreate the only man that by combining its DNA with that of a modern elephant is at least one <Music/Noise> company now that are using the gene editing technology and animals like in pigs to create pigs that would be better organ donors for humans I think the micro pig to Chinese genomics Institute BG I began reading micro pigs to study diseases but now they're going to sell them as pets for sixteen hundred dollars and given to the micro pig race Miley Cyrus has one yes that's the way the idea of you know the sort of a fanciful use in a way of G editing innovate making the animals that we think are cute <Music/Noise>

about ourselves our history in the future just begin by telling what you mean by the social genomics revolution what's revolutionary about it and describe kind of the Ark of the revolution where we are in that ok well the social justice revolution is really just getting started I would say when Bill Clinton stood up in the year two thousand and now set the book of life had been decoded we're here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome without a doubt this is the most important most wondrous map ever produced by humankind everyone thought everything was going to change suddenly we're going to have personalized medicine we're going to I don't know what it will revolutionize the diagnosis prevention and treatment of most if not all human diseases but actually not much happened for the first decade or so the great scientific hope was to find single easily identifiable genes that controlled cancer or depression or intelligence or even just high so that turned out to be an exception rather than a rule that's Jason Fletcher he's an economist at the University of Wisconsin Madison and he's calm he's co author on the genome factor most of what we care about most of life's important outcomes are not one gene one disease are more like hundreds or thousands of genes all with really tiny effects if you can even find them having a map of the genome is one thing in the Bill Clinton era there was a lack of good data that has changed and now we have this what I call the revolution is this surface of cheap data cheap generic data just two decades ago a Casa billion dollars to sequence a single genome and now <Music/Noise> I could spit make up and send it to one of the popular sequencing outfits in four hundred dollars or four hundred and fifty dollars we can get millions of answers the question What is our DNA look like anyone who sends their saliva into twenty three in me just a small saliva sample to learn about your ancestry through York twenty three pairs of chromosomes and make you who you are to get their ancestry or their supposed health risks as now basically agreed to be the part of their database that will be studying ness has well over a million samples of mostly U S citizens and all that data is being pulled together and both genetic analysis and social science analysis to try to understand the vast array of outcomes were all interested and that's anything from Alzheimer's and dementia on the hillside to measures of educational attainment and socioeconomic position on the social science side so we finally have big data sets with lots of genetic markers across the entire set of chromosomes and where now actually making robust discoveries that are withstanding replication and seem pretty solid I think that's the start of the revolution but warning it's still early days that's right so humans are very complicated and the amount of data were talking about is in the millions or tens of millions of locations energy know what does this mean for technology like crisp or gene editing I think that's going to be very exciting firsts a limited number of single gene diseases diseases like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease and Huntington's disease but most things we care about in today's world heart disease Alzheimer's IQ height body mass index diabetes risk all of those things are highly apologetic that means that there are the sum total of many little effects all across the chromosomes and that probably means we're not going to be doing <Music/Noise> a thousand different locations in the genome least not anytime soon but with all the genomic data that are being accumulated scientists have been devising a system to make sense of it all we have a tool that emerge called apologetics court to take all the small effect sizes are finding across many many many genes add them all up in the new created a summary scale of your predicted likelihood of doing X where X can be smoking or getting dementia we're going to college but those scores aren't predicting very well right now so before anything drastic happened socially I would think that those scores we need to get a lot better when state is really starts playing a lot of the variation in society than I would start worrying worrying because why the use by external authorities and companies of this information that's definitely scary I think the other dimension is going to being in the marriage market where people just take it upon themselves to want to know genetic information about their potential mates I mean if you knew that your potential mate was a high likelihood of developing early dementia you might think twice before getting married I mean you know the new types are for hookups but Gina type is forever so the technology for that is here now could be use in infertility clinics could be used on dating apps where people could put their genetic profiling from twenty three need to OK Cupid in the selection of course is something we all do everyday is how we choose our friends allies and enemies our political leaders some traits are observable others less so some are hair table others not if the selection potential afforded by these new technologies is frightening to you keep in mind the thing that's new about this is the technology remember the eugenics movement that was justified by a preference for preference for people of certain European ancestry are not all European ancestry but certain just the favored groups to have more children and to be given resources to the exclusion of all their people and of course that led pretty directly to Nazi ism and the extermination of millions of people and it also was used as the pseudo science behind at least decades of racial injustice in the United States and many other countries <Music/Noise> is the nightmare that is given Jennifer Dowd an actual nightmares <Music/Noise> that really was one of the defining moments for me in terms of thinking about getting involved in the ethical conversation so I had a dream in which I was working away I think I was in my office actually and a colleague of mine came in and said I'd like to introduce you to someone and I would like you to explain the crisper technology to him and he led me into a room and there was a late in the room and there was someone sitting in sort of silhouette in a chair with his back to me and he turned around and I realized with this horror and I can feel it right now isn't telling the story I feel its chill in my body you know that that I realize that it was Adolf Hitler and he was looking at me with very very intent look on his face and an eager kind of look you know he wanted to know about this technology and I felt this incredible sense of fear both a personal fear but also profound kind of existential fears that you know it someone like that were to get a hold of a powerful technologies like this how would they deploy it and of course it you know when I woke up from that dream and I you know thinking about it subsequently and it was really scary to think about and I thought you know this we haf to proceed responsibly here we cannot just early for me myself I can just carry on with my next experiment in my lab I really have to get involved in in a broader discussion about this it's just too important a subject I hear I don't mean to at all diminish year your argument but I hear a lot of scientists make a similar argument which is you know look we're we're doing our best on our end and we <Music/Noise> to have this conversation kind of in public especially with people who had the leverage mostly politicians that say Choo makes smart choices my question is does a good mechanism or forum for that kind of conversation really exist well I think we're kind of building as were going at some level I've been involved in organizing a number of meetings there right now they're fairly small in focus but the idea is to really answer we hope that question that you just posed is how do you do that how do you bring people from these different walks of life together so they can have a meaningful discussion I don't have the answer yet but I do think that has to involve formats that are accessible to people it can't just be a bunch of academics that you know maybe talking in the silo to each other right exactly cannot be that it has to be using various ways I think the media are going to be very important I think people that write science fiction are going to be important I think that movie makers are going to be important musicians and various kinds of visual artists are going to be important I think all of those people are very skillful at communication communicating ideas and they can do it in in some ways much more effectively than you know a lot of technical jargon would ever achieve so probably the most enticing and certainly the most controversial aspect of crisper is the power to reshape human beings whether an individual with an illness or a generation of a family or maybe an entire population so obviously it's a gigantic area and something that probably nobody doesn't bring a lot of strong prior to the table with already can you just talk about this issue and <Music/Noise> thinking about the issue in kind where you've landed I've seen an evolution of my own thinking quite frankly you know I think that I sort of have gone from feeling very uncomfortable with the you know sort of the idea of making changes to human embryos is especially for anything that would be considered you know not medically essential to to thinking that you know there may come a time I don't think we're there now <Music/Noise> it's I don't think it's right around the corner but I think there may come a time when that sort of application is embraced and is going to be deployed and and I think that for me the important thing is not to reject its actually to understand it and and really think through the implications not let me ask just to take a step back and talk about actual therapeutic I guess treatment and the difference between germ mine and semantic editing ah yes the sets are important to understand the difference so you know most of the applications that we've been talking about especially in in medicine right now involve what we call some attic cellar editing and that means making changes to the DNA in cells of a particular tissue in a person that's already fully developed but those changes do not become hair table they can't be passed on to the next generation but the contrast that is changes to the germ line and that means making changes the DNA of embryos or eggs or sperm changes that are inherited by future generations and become effectively permanent in the human genome and so I think there's a profound difference between those two uses because if you're doing something that affects one person has to regulate of course not to make sure that it's safe and effective but it affects just that one person whereas if you make a change that affects somebody is all of their children all of their children's children et-cetera That is really profound and it really does affect ultimately you know human evolution and presumably let's say I cared enough about some strain of hair and ability enough to do it"

to the Oracle of Omaha Warren buffet the No not that famous Midwestern billionaire this one my name is Charles Koch and I'm chairman and CEO <Music/Noise> of Koch Industries he's also one half of the controversial entity known as the Koch brothers Koch brothers are trying to buy America day all the culprit is helping to lead <Music/Noise> in my view against working families in this country he must've seen this coming right I knew it would be nasty and unpleasant I did know it would be this dishonest Charles Koch isn't much of a media fixture but over the course of several weeks he sat down with free comics Radio four series of conversations he discussed what his critics say about him most the fact that I'm familiar with the wrong how he first came to see modern politics as corrupt my first real brush was this Was I thinkin' nineteen seventy two when Nixon was campaigning and why so worried about America's future worrying increasingly have the under both Republicans and Democrats toward a system of control dependency in cronyism the petting individuals and groups against each other and destroying opportunity in progress he talked about the political issues of the day I will let anybody and who will make the country better and no <Music/Noise> make the works and that would be the same thing of people who are illegally the The I'm not in favor of people doing drugs on the other hand extreme criminalization has it were the the obviously if the temperature continues to go up at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful the we ask the questions we know your thinking now the public line I knew however is that well everything that Charles Koch are the Koch brothers advocate societal easy or politically is just an effort to protect or extend their business interests so make your best case how and why that's not sell we oppose the ext Anders the tax bill which are tax exemptions and we made a lot of money from those we oppose this border adjustment fee that would make us over a billion dollars a year ago on we hear praise from some unlikely quarters the call rather uh <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the credit the end we get to what kind of person Charles Koch really is I have to say I say this with the utmost respect your total nerd aren't you know what a fun loving guy I was a rugby player you give me the posts the The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host Stephen of Mary the the the <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> Charles Koch lives in Wichita Kansas which is where he grew up got away for many years two grown kids a daughter who's a writer and book publisher and the sun which runs the Koch Industries fertilizer business Charles Koch was born in nineteen thirty five the second of four boys brother David lives in New York he's also involved in Koch Industries though less so than Charles and his the other half of the so called Koch brothers' political funding machine the other two brothers aren't involved in the political network or Koch Industries a reflection of decades of legal combat if you like really nasty family feud that last for decades and involved billion dollar settlements might want to read a book called Sons of Wichita how the Koch brothers became America's most powerful private dynasty Koch Industries today meanwhile is the second largest private firm in the United States after Cargill it was started by Charles Koch father as an oil an engineering firm now it's one of the biggest industrial conglomerates in the world with a hundred and twenty thousand employees deals on everything from chemicals and electronics to paper products and textiles some of its best known brands Georgia Pacific lycra and stain Master carpeting its annual revenues are estimated at about one hundred billion dollars Charles and David Koch are estimated to be worth nearly fifty billion dollars apiece Charles in case you're wondering has no interest in retiring if I did <Music/Noise> dead in six months so briefly tell me what you actually do in a in a given day well I get to work at seven or or little before and I meet with customers and meet with employees I go over <Music/Noise> projects opportunities <Music/Noise> problems and I gather information from all different sources and I'm very strong on driving innovation creative destruction and making sure <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and innovative won Koch Industries has been a gargantuan business success but that's not what made Charles Koch famous that happened much more recently when he intensified his funding of political and social causes and political campaigns because he has funded almost exclusively Republican candidates and causes typically associated with Republicans he is least in the eyes of most Democrats and obvious enemy and George Soros of the right but he and his brother David have become more than just an enemy they're seen as a bet Mar plying the radical right with so called dark money that in fact is the name of the journalist Jane Mayer's Expos say on the Koch brothers they gather around a group of four hundred to four hundred and fifty other phenomenally <Music/Noise> rich and influential American conservatives and it's given them the equivalent of kind of a private tutor Craddock political <Music/Noise> soul it's trying to untangle the rhetoric and reality and try to figure out if Charles Koch views are as Doctor Nair as are sometimes portrayed or perhaps a bit more nuance to understand his views on politics and society and business is probably helps to understand where they come from starting with his father Fred Koch studied engineering at MIT and he was tough she was Dutch and his favorite sayings you can tell the Dutch but you can't tell much in the nineteen twenties Fred Koch had a small oil refining firm that he was trying to grow into a big one he aggressively challenge the industry leader which in turn sued Koch for copying its technology eventually he would lose in court in the meantime look for business is overseas and he made his first millions building oil refining facilities in Stalin's Soviet Union which he hated the statism and collectivism cronyism and corruption what I saw in Russia Fred Koch leader Roh convinced me that communism was the most evil force the world has ever seen and I must do everything in my power to fight back home he helped start the John Birch Society which took anti communism to the point of need of ism and racism Koch also learned that the lawsuit he had last been rigged opponent fought off a judge from this one pair of events in Fred coax life getting shut down by a crooked competitor and working under the direction of a communist dictator you can see the entire blueprint for Charles Koch view of the world the enemy's cronyism special interests and intrusive government solutions what my <Music/Noise> for the good society is what we call free and open society liberated people can do amazing things here productive innovative and entrepreneurial and people who are subjugated who are intimidated controlled or dependent tend not to be Charles Koch hadn't planned on joining his father's business so he was always tough on me as a kid so I figured I'd need to go back through that again like his father Charles studied engineering at MIT after i finish of MIT I went to work for three D lol IT consulting firm and so after I'd been there two years or so my father call me and when you join the firm and I turned him down so then you are not crazy about going back to Wichita that point together yes ride and I was learning a lot having a great time playing rugby <Music/Noise> be living in Boston I mean a lot of great girls schools and the wonderful girls that they back there so I went two years to come back so then he called me and he said son he said my health is poor his blood pressure was two thirty over one twenty if you can imagine they just didn't have the drugs then of course to treat it and he said I don't have long to live in either you come back to run the company or I'm going to sell Coke agreed to come back to Wichita to take over small equipment division called Coke engineering and so that worked great so then he turned over the other areas to me and but he <Music/Noise> than he thought the live six years and I I got to work with them for six years after his father died Coke planned the firm's future someone <Music/Noise> the businesses we had and then my view as it still is is that the way to succeed is to understand what capabilities you have to create superior value find the best opportunities for him and then improve costly improve those capabilities add new ones which will open new opportunities for you so that's been our vision and our approach ever sent so we just kept building capabilities adding <Music/Noise> finding new opportunities which gave us additional capabilities and so long I see that when I look at Koch Industries employee satisfaction ratings which you can look up these days the firm does quite well but in terms of the CEO ratings that's you you do really well he met <Music/Noise> two percent approval rating now I have no idea who's writing these maybe this is you and your wife riding all the reviews know I have this first I've heard of it was good I I would rate myself quite so high but <Music/Noise> somebody is that belief so if someone in business starting I'll ask you for some structural basic advice of running a firm managing people juggling it all what would you tell them Well the first thing is to understand what your innate abilities are and what you have a passion for <Music/Noise> willing to work are at and then think through how that translates into how you create value for others because that's going to determine how successful you are and how what kind of life you have how fulfilled you are and so in an <Music/Noise> you need to create value of course first of all for your customers then you need to create value for your employees and partners and then you need to create value for society at large what excites you about the business still what keeps you coming <Music/Noise> eighties what keeps you coming into the office every day a year you one of the ten richest people on the planet so presumably don't need <Music/Noise> why I mean I I love what I love this innovation finding new <Music/Noise> to create value improving I mean I believe everything <Music/Noise> can be done much better and will be over time so that's what keeps me turn on plus helping other people transform themselves become lifelong learners and constantly <Music/Noise> how to create more value or if you've been listening to big names radio for a while folks management philosophy may sound familiar it's built on a lifetime of reading economics and other social sciences starting at MIT I became fascinated with the scientific progress the philosophy of science the scientific method and man I became fascinated with social progress as well as scientific and so I started studying economics psychology sociology and at general philosophy and then applying these principles I learned in the business and that's what ultimately <Music/Noise> to our management philosophy which is what we call Market Based Management for someone who's never heard of it let's just start with your brief description of Market Based Management Market Based Management has five dimensions vision virtue and talents knowledge processes decision rights and Senate's and when you put that together in a package an integrated package it gives leaders and everybody in the company a toolkit to solve problems and capture opportunities critical part of our mansion philosophy is building what we call a challenge culture and we find that's one of the biggest problems and acquisitions we make in many of you challenge your boss is really hurt your career here if you don't challenge your boss not to show how smart you are or be clever but because you see a problem in what's being done and or you have a better idea you believe if you don't challenge your not really doing your job I mean if you're here and as a <Music/Noise> and your people are challenging you you're obviously not a good leader because they're intimidated <Music/Noise> haven't encouraged um you <Music/Noise> there for a deal be put down or look stupid to ever worry that strong decision rights will tip into not quite anarchy but you know a two D centralized management mechanism where individual managers may have such autonomy or such decision right sadly such strong decision rights that they will turn into mini dictators right that is absolutely a danger and so what we like at great is you see in many companies they'll get centralized find that's not working so they get de centralized the way we like at it is certain things need to be centralized that is the people at the center have better <Music/Noise> of what say the effect of something on the other businesses or how that fits the overall strategy are our market trends than the people at the plant but there are other things that the people to plant have better knowledge so it's a division of labor by comparative <Music/Noise> and so we are very centralized on some things and very decentralized on others and isn't perfect and doesn't always work great no but it's a constant balance and reworking and trial and there I'd like to talk about incentives for a little bit because as you and I know that the cornerstone of a you know economic thinking so because of the way that incentives work at your firm a given employee can start making more money than his or her manager I'm curious how people respond to that does that create turmoil have you address that by course I'm not into their psyche but let me just say it works great I mean it's I mean doesn't like a basketball does the coach quit because LeBron James makes more than he said the bride go for it because you're making you're making me look good so keep it up and I hope you make five times what I do and that's the kind of culture we tried to build here so from what you're telling me now and from what I've read it sounds as if Market Based Management the operating system of your business is pretty similar to what you would like to be you personally Charles Koch would like to be the operating system for society at large a kind of structured principled environment that encourages self determination so on but but surely it's a lot harder to you know create or impose this kind of framework on society than on a private firm yes well I I mean I know what you're driving it so that the answer is yes but not structured I want a system of the spine to what I want my ideal world <Music/Noise> for it is to have truly have a society that represented the principals in the Declaration of Independence that is everyone is created equal with certain inalienable rights and governments are instituted to secure those rights and so then I like it the four core institutions in society that is education communities business and government and determine OK what is the ideal for each of these types of institutions that will help move us in that direction so back in the nineteen sixties long before you were involved politically as you are now you are good that the role of government in the capitalist system we should be quote only to keep a check on those who might attempt to interfere with the laws of supply and demand so I'm curious to hear you know how deeply you truly believe that then that the role should be that limited and how you feel about it now right well I've matured a little bit being <Music/Noise> would hope that finally so I look at government and so I stay or what is government and I I like Max Weber's definition of government the best or to its most helpful to me that is the government is the social institution with a legal monopoly on force in a given geographic area so the nature of government is force and so <Music/Noise> that government should act when force works better than voluntary cooperation competition and so the starting point on things it does is use force when force is inherent in it like to protect the country from foreign invasion police tried to protect people from being robbed and killed but that needs to be a social safety net so then the question is What is the optimum social safety net and how would that work I have to say and I say this with the utmost respect you're a total nerd aren't you know what a fun loving guy <Music/Noise> rugby player you give me but I am yeah <Music/Noise> now for many <Music/Noise> you avoided politics and <Music/Noise> you stopped avoiding it so why what changed well it was in was during the Bush administration I started <Music/Noise> and and giving that kid scholarship you're interested and self transformation <Music/Noise> self development <Music/Noise> we've been talking and then supporting professors <Music/Noise> heard about what I was interested in and so on and then got into OK we need to flesh out the policy implications of these ideas and then get into ok now <Music/Noise> of people who are interested in them we need to help them mobilize <Music/Noise> to get this stuff down and out George Bush forty three was selected and it looked like he was going to advance some of these ideas and then he went the other way and under ham government the federal government grew fifty percent more than it did under Clinton and roughly three times the number restrictive regulations were passed under him and we got in disastrous wars and just one thing after the others so well I mean we've got to have people who don't just campaign <Music/Noise> ideas but who really believe them <Music/Noise> support those who advance these ideas and and that's how it got started it in <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> coming up on Freakonomics Radio once he got started to reach broader and broader and so we had a number of successes or failures with

speaking with Charles Koch CEO of Koch Industries but much more famously one of the man behind a massive funding operation designed to blow up what Cook sees as the political status well the <Music/Noise> the let me ask you this and I don't mean to sound skeptical or snarky but why do you care personally so much about shaping society at large most people I'm guessing ninety <Music/Noise> a half percent of people listening to us talk don't know anyone that's anywhere near <Music/Noise> as wealthy and has accomplished and powerful is you and I think a natural inclination to say Well that person just wants to exert the power for ego gratification or for further enjoyment or maybe for further magnifying you know his own wealth and power so persuade me that those are not the motivations and that you're kind of desired social engineering is for the greater good we fought a revolution to get rid of royalty and we don't need road here it's seeping back and in different forms but basically I was blast starting <Music/Noise> to have learned certain principles concepts and values that transform my life and enable me to accomplish more than ever dreamed possible so sense that time I wanted to give as many people the opportunity to do the same that is to develop their full potential and become lifelong <Music/Noise> and and lead successful fulfilling lives now when somebody gets their thought <Music/Noise> that's what they're thinking about everyday that affects their whole approach to life so they think OK I want to be that my family wanted at my communities and that's just it changes their metal <Music/Noise> changes the way their brain is hardwired and that's what we find <Music/Noise> work in education and everything I have seen the side is transform or people thousands of people and so they <Music/Noise> and man as Frederick Douglas did what she got the side is he didn't just fight to free other slaves he fought for women's rights for immigrants rights for persecuted religious minorities rights and that's what we see so that's what I want people to be liberated I don't control them but why do you care so much becoz it transform <Music/Noise> and I and so I just love to see it transform other people's lives because if you have a success and you feel good about it then you want more of that and that's what I get I mean it's you can say it's like a drug but it's my hope is a drug that makes me work for good not for the list of charitable causes supported by Charles Koch and his brother David is long and diverse and would surely find approval with even the most about political enemies David is particularly well <Music/Noise> for funding the arts and medical research among the Koch Industries beneficiaries are the United Negro College Fund Project jumpstart which provides construction training and the movement for criminal justice reform well I think like everything else we need the legal system that is just for the punishment fits the crime and we also need a system that if people make a mistake learn from their mistake they need I have a second chance rather than ruin their lives now it is a is a tough sell because people believe God you're <Music/Noise> all the kernels were going to be less safe and know the idea is to make people most safe when you have draconian penalties penalties that don't fit the crime then the police are about to arrest somebody for let's say selling marijuana <Music/Noise> and you may have a gun in your car because you're afraid of being attacked so what is somebody going to do when they're going to be arrested I mean they don't have the added to that gosh okay I'm going to get a penalty but I'll be alright it's going to ruin <Music/Noise> so what do they do they fight back or run <Music/Noise> they get shot and the whole thing escalates this project aligned coke with the Obama White House in fact President Obama noted when he spoke to the NWS EP in two thousand and fifteen

freak the As an economist why <Music/Noise> interested in things like marriage and fertility things like that sigh my interest and an issues of poverty US poverty in particular I and it turns out that poverty and family structure are very intertwined in this country and so if you're thinking about the economic well being of children in particular it's really hard not to be interested in questions of family structure the eye that is Melissa Carney a professor of economics at the University of Maryland we spoke with Carney before for an episode called Is America ready for a new lose lottery and in fact in your recent national survey of thousands of one in five American adults in their greatest chance of accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars was the lottery that number jumps to forty percent for folks making less than twenty five thousand dollars of year and we spoke with her for an episode called The Early Education come way too late we find that kids are preschool age in places where they can watch Sesame Street were fourteen percent less likely to fall behind when they got elementary school so if you aren't economists trying to figure out why so many pour adults but their financial hopes in the lottery in whether Sesame Street hope spore kids do better in school makes sense to go all the way back to the start of the lifecycle marriage and fertility or lot of cases just fertility <Music/Noise> sixty five percent of births and the US were to unmarried mothers ok that was five percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers in nineteen sixty fast forward now to two thousand and fourteen in two thousand fourteen over forty percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers so first of all how the anything that spikes from five percent to forty percent is big change but we're talking about something as elemental as family structure that mean the kits are being born to less educated single moms they are falling farther and farther behind that probably doesn't surprise you decades of social science research have confirmed the sad fact but it may surprise you certain surprise Melissa Kearney was what some fascinating new data told her about marriage and fertility <Music/Noise> she's pretty sure would confirm a hunch she had she's pretty sure it would offer some good news and facts the data showed the opposites the <Music/Noise> the six The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the <Music/Noise> the the <Music/Noise> the the link between family structure and poverty something academic researchers like Melissa Carney known about for a long time thus really hard for researchers to establish the cause all the facts of family structure or marriage and kids outcomes of course because we don't randomly assign kids to married or unmarried parents bites there's a lot of research that works really hard to sort of isolate factors and that research consistently shows that I can to have with two <Music/Noise> parents you have lower rates of poverty a higher sort of cognitive test scores in childhood have fewer behavioral problems they seem to have better health outcomes are less likely to live in poverty when they're twenty five or more likely to complete college and they're less likely to become a young unmarried parents themselves and what is your marital and maternal status I am a married mother and thirty am but that does not make me a biased researcher year and so you share use are you not shaming everybody else by imposing your social mask and play unfair if people don't want you know I'm not saying anybody should get married who doesn't wanna get married what I'm saying is that we see in the data that kids are born to married mothers have better short term and long term outcomes were the <Music/Noise> these days roughly four million babies are born each year in the U S That's a fertility rate of sixty two babies every one thousand women of what's called prime childbearing age fifteen forty four if you go back sixty years to the baby boom call that for reason the rate of child bearing is nearly double so that's one big change in the fertility picture another one as Carney <Music/Noise> so in nineteen sixty five percent of births in the US were to unmarried mothers in two dozen fourteen over forty percent of births and the US were unmarried mothers yet this is really a dramatic increase and if you're convinced as Carney is that kids in unmarried households have worse outcomes well bad news and and the forty percent sort of masks really high rates in particular groups so seventy one percent of births to African American mothers now are outside marriage seventy one percent of births to women under the age of twenty five outside of marriage the concern about African American kids in single parent homes has been around for long time not allowed a bad situation in the pool but rather a bad situation worse it's Daniel Patrick Moynihan sociologist turned politician became a longtime Democratic senator from New York but before that nineteen sixties he worked in the Labor Department where he co wrote a report came to be known as The Moynihan Report its official name using the nomenclature of the time was The Negro Family The Case for National Action about the royal family headed by women the divorce rate is to nap time as an only the the the number of fatherless children keep going his argument was that room and do better this is a father in the home and Rachel in a sociologist at Johns Hopkins he saw a rise in single Parenthood in children living without fathers in the home I saw the rez bigger among African Americans he focused on them how'd you learn how to be a father a mother and your older sister people around you there is no spot where children are just brought up without any of that support the family gives the reporter as you can imagine was controversial when it was clear that racism was a significant factor and the lack of good jobs was a big problem got to get him and the way can a man can run a family that lived up to the stock very sick with Adam we have to have helped out just tell this country that but Moynihan argued that it was all about economics as he wrote quote The fundamental problem is that a family structure evidence not final but powerfully persuasive is that the Negro family in urban ghettos is crumbling so long as this situation persists the cycle of poverty and disadvantage will continue to repeat itself but here's the difference and are true and again that can lay hands day this was an issue relating to poor people and African Americans the issue truly means of single parent families it's still the case that there are lots of such families so if you think of the stereotypical unmarried mother <Music/Noise> sixty five you might think an unmarried teenager living <Music/Noise> who'd likely be from a minority group if you think of the typical unmarried mother today she's white she's in her twenties and she's probably living with the guy who's the father of the chiller that's the big change that we've seen that huge shift in the middle the rate of unmarried births to non Hispanic white women is nearly thirty percent now triple what it was in nineteen eighty so that is a big shift but as Melissa Carney points out the most powerful predictor of single motherhood is education level fewer than ten percent of births to women with a college degree are outside marriage as compared to roughly sixty percent of births to a man with a high school degree or with the Lassen High School degree this surge in unmarried births among low education women seems to present a double whammy number one these kids are likely born into a household with one income at most and number two since low education moms to have low incomes that means fewer resources no one of course is looking to beat up on low income single parent families it's also considered bad form at least in some circles to prescribe marriage as a solution Melissa Kearney gets that but she also gets that the so called marriage premium is legit I am perfectly comfortable saying that it looks I being born to two you are living with two married parents is beneficial for kids and I <Music/Noise> acted and say don't wanna see that right because it sounds really socially conservative and preachy but I think was really interesting is if you think of how higher educated higher income parents are behaving they are still almost entirely having children inside of marriage both parents are investing an extraordinary amount of both financial resources but time and energy into their kids and so you know in some sense it's a luxury to be able to say Oh I don't want to make social commentary like that well that's because the kids of higher educated higher income parents they're doing extremely well but the kids are being born to less educated single moms they are falling farther and farther behind and so to not be honest about the ailing is doing anybody any favors even if it's politically more comfortable <Music/Noise> so the big question what does cause this huge spike in unmarried births one obvious fact consider is that marriage itself has become a lot less popular in the US we looked at the many <Music/Noise> for this in a two part For Economics radio episode is called Why Mary and a lot of unmarried couples of course live together still what accounts for so many more unmarried births among mothers with less education social conservatives tend to point to the breakdown of old school social norms social liberals cite less access to contraception although that has improved a lot and especially the lack of economic opportunity that is man without good jobs are eager to marry or from the other end of the equation they are considered good husband material Alyssa Carnes world this is called The Marriage of Elm and fury I said that's based on this idea that's been around since William Julius Wilson's really seminal work in the nineteen eighty is arguing that this decline in the economic security of less educated man and in certain populations are demographic groups in particular is behind this rise in non marital childbearing in retreat from marriage will do a bit of those days you can find a guy who's got a decent steady income but those guys have been disappearing because the the industrial jobs that used to have her no <Music/Noise> are in church or live again the people in the middle that hurt the most by the changes our economy it's the factory jobs that used to employ people with high school degrees that have moved overseas or been caught in it so that's the theory that the unmarried birth spike is due at least in large part to a shrinking pool of men with good stable employment and so and so sort of hypothesized in the reverse I've been keen to find a situation where we've seen an improvement and less educated man's economic situation the accent straight only Melissa Kearney could find a scenario like that where less educated men suddenly had a job and wage boost and the fracking them adding constitutes the rare context where black men without a college degree have seen an improvement and their employment and earnings prospects in recent years so that gave us a place to look at how family formation outcomes responded great and I'm just curious as a researcher do you get really excited when you see you know in the news something like the fracking boom because you know it'll provide some great variable some shocks to the system that you'll then exploit to answer some research questions yeah it's it's always a joke among them para ka AI researchers you see some shock and you know whether it's red with anger now the society he has an open question but do you know you can help this instinctive thought of food that provides great exhaustion is variation that I can explain and so the fracking boom these look wise cracking them is really having sort of meets our standard in the sense that it's determined by preexisting Geological formations in the earth and even the most you know pursue kitty economists will tend to grants that whether there is this Geological formation under your county is probably exhaustion is to fail information preferences <Music/Noise> exhaustion is a family formation preferences meaning what exactly the concern in trying to figure out how economic conditions affect things like family formation outcomes is that if you see a place where the men are working and have high wages and you want to relate that to their rates of marriage there's always an issue of O will the kind of <Music/Noise> live there and have steady jobs those are the exactly the kind man who would make good husbands and fathers and so this isn't really independent variation but when you take the place and all of us Aiden because of this technological innovation in the early two thousands all of the side and the geology under the county becomes really economically value of all such that now there's an economic boom <Music/Noise> likely to get jobs and have higher earnings potential that's really independent and to other aspects of sort of who's living there and family formation and other related preference as fracking or hydraulic fracturing is a technique to extract oil and gas from the earth around for many decades but as Carney notes technological innovations led to a fracking boom in the early two thousands the ramifications have been huge environmentally it's been great concern about pollution destabilization critics of fracking say it harms the environment they worry that the method contaminate groundwater there's also been a massive shift in global petroleum markets the US started producing so much oil and gas that reclaimed its title as the top oil producing country in the world this led to economic and geopolitical scrambling and Saudi Arabia Russia and elsewhere Alyssa Carney wasn't concerned about these huge changes not much at least the fracking boom was for her

called male earnings marriage able men and non marital fertility evidence from the fracking boom the central idea if the disappearance of good jobs for less educated men of the past few decades was a contributing factor in huge spike in unmarried births may be an economic stake among less educated man would lead to a rise in Mary Burke's first thing to consider is how economists think about childbearing decisions the <Music/Noise> people have greater levels of income are less equal we should expect they should have more children but we also know that there's a price effects of kids are expensive so if the price of having kids goes up for the price of child rearing goes up and expect people will have fewer kids fewer choices in having children correspond very much the way that they correspond with you know buying a new car versus use car no car tall and so on I was afraid in assets and I don't know that of the top my head but I do think the evidence is pretty strong at this point there a <Music/Noise> of rigorous studies showing that when there are some sort of exhaustion is shocked in hand we see an increase in fertility so for example a paper I wrote a couple years ago with our graduates in at the time Lisa dat lame we found that during the housing boom homeowners had more kids and mentors had fewer kids and that's totally consistent with people who own a house saw their home equity went up the case in terms of job you or wage boom how does fracking compare ok so I am these fracking games have been touted as creating tens of thousands of jobs in providing starting salaries at fifty thousand dollars for recent high school graduates with average earnings for folks are actually working in oil and gas extraction jobs of between seventy thousand and eighty thousand and also there's positive spillover errors in nearby counties so it's important to realize that the positive economic shock coming from local fracking is not limited to folks who are working in fracking jobs there's a local economic booms and other industries also see an uptick in business so tell us just a bit about the data how many locations are we talking about generally and then in terms of trying to measure the relationship between income and childbearing and marriage and all that where those data all coming from her someday be clear that we're not looking at North Dakota and Montana and what's called the The Bakken region up there I think that captures a lot of the public imagination or attention when it comes to thinking about fracking you're not looking at them because the scenarios to pronounce there it's two migratory exactly we're not looking at them because it's a really unique situation up there where a lot of the fracking jobs were filled by in incline migrants and so I North decoder the counties that fracking their their populations increase significantly in response to the fracking boom so it's a very different setting where looking instead add add Pennsylvania Oklahoma tax S West Virginia Ohio and number of other places where there wasn't really a large migration response where looking at data from the early two thousand and during this period nine hundred and sixty six counties in the US had new fracking wells and weeds he means thrill level information from a private company that sells this day that we know the exact location of every well and when it started rolling and then we link that was his government data on wages and jobs as well as I fight the statistics data on the universe of person the US and on census data about marriage is an eye rates of cohabitation so there's a lot of data being pulled together for this analysis so the underlying idea is that one reason fewer mothers have been getting married over the past few decades because fewer men have good economic prospects and therefore if there's a job boom or wage boom that would theoretically increase the supply of men with better economic prospects yes that's kind of the theory that you want to test that was the hypothesis that three Okay And how that work out what did you actually learn from your data set I know my speculation going in was that an increase in that the economic opportunities for men would lead to a reduction in amount of ang and in fact the data so the opposites or let say didn't support that so the data do show that in response to these increase economic activity and earnings potential we do see an increase in births but interesting Lee there's the same response unmarried births and non married Doris and no increase and marriage so this does not offer support for what I'll call a reverse marriage a womans story where as if we see more marriage able manner that will see an increase in marriage at that the data do not support that ok so there is a fertility boom when there's a fracking boom How big is the fertility boom and can you compare it to the size of the fracking boom yet so what our estimate suggests is that an additional thousand dollars of fracking production per capita is innocent is associated with an increase of six births per thousand only God yet know the other babies I know that's consistent with previous evidence so I think one of the most interesting things in our research was a comparison into the coal boom and bust situation it's a similar economic shock it's a similar industry it there and similar sort of area as the Appalachian region is impose a similar employment cohort then as well re education wise age wise stuff like that that's right is just a different period so the coal boom and bust happen and seventies and eighties and what we find is that a ten percent increase in earnings associated with the coal boom led to very similar sized fat increases and married birth rates but as in the fracking them like an eight percent increase in marital birth rates for ten percent increase in earnings that call them and a twelve percent increase unmarried birth rates associated the fracking boom but the non marital births response is very different so a ten percent increase in earnings associated with coal them actually lead to a reduction in non marital births but it's twelve percent increase in non marital births was is it you know with that ten percent increase in earnings associated with fracking so that's where the reall the response differed and in the earlier period when earnings increases in with a cold room marriage increased and as we've been saying there's no increase for the fracking boom I know coal boom produced more marriage and more kids in fewer kids born to unmarried moms where the fracking boom produced more kids but no <Music/Noise> and a lot more kids born to unmarried moms yet harsh an increase and married <Music/Noise> married person the fracking them so I mean we speculated that a you know this suggests that social context is really important to determining their response to economic changes in understand that so in the seventies and eighties very few births or outside of marriage and there was a social stigma associated with non married births and so in the seventies and eighties when you got more income it looks like you had more births but only if you are married and now reading period were non marital births are extremely calm and in the last educated populations and so now we see is if you get more income you have more babies for a fight but it doesn't matter whether you're married or not that's a real difference to Howell <Music/Noise> is the fracking industry ok so that's a good question so I I don't know the specifics but what I can say is we do confirm the data add that the increase in wages and job opportunities are twice as large for man as for women in these areas and that's important to keep in mind because we would expect that I'm the sort of marriage birth response is to see now versus male economic opportunities would be different I'm curious whether these jobs in this industry is seen as more cyclical or less durable than other industries yet we wondered about that so in the data do show that the impacts of new production and wages are persistent so two years after the initial fracking drilling begins in a county two thirds of the wage income is persistent and so it doesn't seem to be a case that sort of summer comes and facts in a county in leaves right away well yeah but I'm thinking if I'm getting the job or if I'm planning to marry someone who's getting that job I may think wow this is a great job and great income right now but given the nature of the industry it may be a two or three year boom and that's and that's and I'm just curious how that might change your <Music/Noise> or childbearing prospects at that rate so that's one of the potential explanations for why we don't find a marriage a fact is that maybe these positive economic shock is thought to be temporary and you know the potential male partners going to go back to being unemployed are having low wages in a couple years so there's a couple thoughts I have on that the first is if people really thought this was just temporary it's surprising then that there's a fertility response right because we do see that this is fracking boom led to an increase in earnings and let that lead to increased childbearing so there would still have to be some asymmetry there is I'm not saying it's impossible but I think it's curious is surprising especially if however you're assuming that the fertility is intentional though I mean if you just thinking about jobs means money which means opportunities to do things like Intel go out and drink in bars and meet people and have sex that's different than having a fertility plan that's all I'm saying that their marital births response is sort of the same size as the non marital births response so married couples are also increasing their fertility in response to this and less inclined to think that that's unintentional <Music/Noise>

<Music/Noise> in our previous episode we look to the study that explored the links between jobs and family structure the findings were surprising and frankly little bit depressing it turns out that the fracking boom which has provided a lot of good jobs for less educated men also lead to a mini baby boom as economics would predict people tend to have more kids when their financial circumstances are solid but economics would also predict that when people's financial circumstances improve they're more likely to form families not just have babies but that did not happen about forty percent of the babies born in the US these days are born to unmarried mothers it's a huge increase of the past few decades coming into the fracking study the researchers had suspected and hoped that good jobs with lead to more stable families it didn't and as you likely know kids born into less stable families are at much higher risk for bad outcomes in life education health income you name it so the next question becomes if more and more of these at risk kids are being born how can society best help them that is what today's episode is about we will begin briefly in Los Angeles so let's start by if you would just say your name and what you do I'm Greg Boyle in I'm a Jesuit priest and I'm the founder and executive director of homeboy Industries which is the largest gang intervention rehab re entry program on the planet father Boyle and homeboy Industries are kind of legendary they've been celebrated over the years G Dawg is Father Greg Boyle of thirty seven Euro jazz would present on that another person inside of us went on his campaign we could become the citizen meetings since there is no place on the planet Earth for more gang members show up to redirect their lives to get some help to begin all over again oil started homeboy in nineteen eighty eight when I was pastor very poor parish and we have eight Kings at war with each other things have gotten somewhat better since then I'm going to bury the guy who was killed but in this high speed chase on Saturday so be my two hundred and eighteen gang member that I've had to bury but it's nothing like the bad old days when I'd have eight funerals in the three week period homeboy caters to gang members have gotten out of prison their motto is Nothing stops a bullet like a job so we have a bakery several restaurants farmers markets but then we have programs alongside like tattoo removal anger management and jobs program trying to find family friendly employers to employ enemies working side by side with each other Boyle preaches what he calls boundless compassion and by that measure homeboy Industries would seem to be a raging success how concerned is he with more traditional outcomes if you're driven by outcomes you're going to only work with a population that will give you good ones you know we're going to work with the most belligerent different cold hearted songs they walk through the door ok but big question How well does a program like this really work and somebody might say to me what how do you know that it works and I would say again no place on the planet Earth has more gamers walk through the door trying to get help and the reason I say that is no gang member would walk through the door if this place didn't help if it didn't somehow were the <Music/Noise> story of Father Boyle and homeboy Industries is inspiring for sure tell that well in a book called tattoos on the heart but his answer about how well homeboy the works no gang member would walk through the door if this place didn't help if it didn't somehow work that doesn't really constitute proof does for that you need to measure outcomes more objectively more scientifically maybe even set up a control group that you could compare the treatment group I say this with no disrespect the Father Boyle and others like him that's not the business they're in but in a world where so many rate hearted people spend so much time and money interventions meant to help other people would be nice to understand which ones work and which ones don't maybe even understand When helping hurts today on Radio one of the earliest modern attempts to find out what really does help at risk kids the program crafted scientific methods on to a social action program that study is one of the bedrock studies in the prevention of crime it was just it was very innovative at the time it's also the story of a tenacious researcher who chased down the data decades later it was a little bit like a mystery and you're trying to track people down and every time you found someone it felt like a little treasure hunt and the conclusions people just assume that if you do something that sounds good that it's the positive effects but it's actually it's actually more complicated than that with no exaggeration it is still shocking to this day the the sauce The The The <Music/Noise> The The W NYC studios this is for economics Radio podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host the The The The The long before her father Greg Boyle and homeboy Industries in all the others like them there was a civic minded Harvard physician named Richard Clarke at the Richard Clarke as it was just a fascinating character that's Brandon Welsh criminology at northeastern University and for the stone eons he was a member of the Calvert family so the cabinets in the lodge is very distinguished family Richard cabin was a philanthropist and Doctor and very much committed to helping people and committed to figuring out what method really worked and that is Jeff say or McCord philosophy professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and he was quite revolutionary in thinking we ought to be taking the same care when we intervene with people's lives as we do when we intervene with their bodies during the Great Depression have commissioned what came to be known as the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study one of the unique features of this study was initiated back in in the thirties was to be a longitudinal survey perspective of tuna survey the purpose of which was what he wanted it to be tested over a very lengthy pre of time something that by today's standards is is unheard of the study would last so long technically it's still going on today and Brandon Welch is now its director yes it's now been recognized as the first randomized experiment of a social program that had been a few earlier experiments in education but nothing like this in social work or crime prevention what drove cab he was appalled by the recidivism <Music/Noise> from the Boston juvenile Court and key really saw that there was a need to move outside of the treatment regime outside of attending two after the fact and so he really coined this view of prevention in the first instance and he was quite convinced but didn't have the evidence to support his being convinced that what we now call mentoring was a fact if Jeff Sayre McCord as you'll hear later on also has an intimate connection to the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study through his late mother who was a criminology us anyway Doctor Cabot idea was that boys and young men headed for trouble could benefit from some mentoring yes so the treatment was larger for two s directed friendship so hoping to get evidence that mentoring would be helpful he went to Cambridge and Somerville at the time of very poor neighborhoods and he identified roughly two hundred and fifty at risk kids is talking to preachers teachers and parents which kids seem to be having trouble and then he also identified two hundred and fifty kids who seem to be doing while in the control group received no special services of the They were what we would call and no treatment control group and basically information about who they were was recorded but there was no intervention with so the boys were first matched their diagnostic pairs maybe he would match you and I because we lived in the same neighborhood and we came from families that were the same size and had the same income and then he flips a coin basically it randomly assigns one person from each of the match pairs to a control group and then in the treatment group are their match partners ok ok so the control group is either a kid doing well working not doing well matched with the opposite one goes in control when those in treatment that race so far that's exactly right that's exactly right and then the treatment took a broad range it was basically councilors who would visit the family counselors would meet every couple weeks with the boys interact with them and help them with homework and take them to the YMCA <Music/Noise> and during the summer months of some of the treatment group voice or able to go to summer camps and so were sent out of the city so that it was Big Brother Big Sister it was kind of mentoring that still is celebrated it lasted from nineteen thirty nine to nineteen forty five so what you had at the end of the Cabot study was this voluminous set of records here's his treasure trove of data with controls and that's O Most nonexistent in social interventions that you have data on a controller the <Music/Noise> ok so the wise is important because whenever you're trying to establish cause and effect in anything whether it's a chemical reaction or something like this a mentorship program for at risk young men need to be able to isolate the inputs and reliably measure the outputs that's a lot easier to do and chemistry than it is with something as complicated as people's lives which is why a lot of the ideas you hear about in the field like criminology tend to be more theoretical than care so that when I started in this field they were I thinks thirteen different ideas about how to prevent delinquency and very little empirical research on any of them it's Denise got Princeton professor in the Department of criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland got France and started out in the field even something as basic as good measurement was elusive so it was for example quite difficult to study schools because they didn't have the instruments to measure things and we just didn't have the technology to measure a lot of different schools in the same way so it was heartening to learn about the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study that study is one of the bedrock studies in the prevention of crime all students learn about it it was just it was very innovative at the time Joan records work to follow up those five hundred youth was just I mean a study like that was very rare in those days ok so Joan McCord was a young criminal a just a couple generations before conference and here's McCord on tape from nineteen ninety six during a period of the nineteen fifty when I was a graduate student I had walked into <Music/Noise> that was filled with records this was while I was on American beef research a sister Eleanor McCabe was a renowned psychologist at Harvard and Stanford who worked on child development and McAfee study was asking mothers to report on how they treated their children and have their children behave the minute you hear that you probably think Wait a minute asking someone about their behavior in the best way to measure behavior is that that's exactly what John McCord was thinking as she was coating the survey responses and I was Cody and thought that it was a shame to believe what mothers had to say about what they did when you can't be objective the vacuum around <Music/Noise> so when Joe McCord heard about the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study which was launched more than a decade earlier she got excited because it had been set up to avoid a lot of the typical problems in social science research first of all it was a bona fide randomized controlled trial which meant you could isolate the effects of the intervention and it also afforded the opportunity to look at long term effects using objective measurements for instance did the kids who got mentorship tend to stay outta trouble get better jobs where they less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol take a lot of work but McCord knew those questions were answerable I applied for grants as a credit record got the grant in fact she would go on to become director of the Cambridge Somerville Youth Study as Brandon Welch is today along the way she taught at Drexel and Temple universities in nineteen eighty eight she became the first female president of the American Society of criminology but back in the nineteen fifties when she began to look into the Cambridge Somerville data she wasn't even the first scholar to do such an analysis so that the first one took place in nineteen forty eight Brandon Walsh again by now the boys from the study the boys were in their early twenties on average and the findings were of a resoundingly <Music/Noise> no effect or the didn't detect any differences and delinquency friend Dean of between the treatment of control groups said that must've been a little bit surprising and disappointing correct indeed it was quite surprising now in the late nineteen fifties Joan record comes along working in partnership with her then husband who was a sociologist these boys were now young man embarking on careers <Music/Noise> engaged in careers and so there was this opportunity to examine one was in a with the program effective could even be a sleeper effect and then two as part of Bill the longer follow up phase of the research and so in the fifties records found what similar findings they found no effect that they found they were no differences between the treatment and control voice online Fendi so that's not very encouraging is that a mentorship program for troubled boys seems to have no long term upside the story might have ended there quite an dramatically were it not for a dramatic technological innovation computers came on the scene and my mom was a really keen to exploit that new resource and had the mathematical ability <Music/Noise> empirical commitment to learn the programming and run the data let's just say are McCourt again she thought once you had that resource you be able to uncover the positive effect she was convinced would be there these boys were now men on their mid forties so she saw a great opportunity to follow up on the inspired commitment to doing social science with as a controlled study and you know was in the grip of at that when I got to college I volunteered as a mentor is a Big Brother UK due in <Music/Noise> inspired by essentially this idea inspired by this program oh yeah and I love doing it I love hanging out with kids and this show and I knew his mother and who to work that the college I went to he was ten or twelve he was right in that age and his father was had been in jail it was mostly tutoring and hanging out and oh you're playing soccer and at the same time I was involved in trying to track down people when my mom start doing follow up with this <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> that's right Joan McCord had enlisted her son help track down the men who nearly thirty years earlier had been boys in the Cambridge Somerville you study it was now the nineteen seventies the world was very different back then no internet no cell phones et-cetera that's Richard Perle rent A records research assistant at the time was also helping track down these men so we really <Music/Noise> physical telephone books on searches of official government records that the name Doctor McCord had gained access to such as the provider statistics Massachusetts We were all figure out where they had lived in and finding doing searches in the library to find people with the same <Music/Noise> in roughly the same communities to be dialing <Music/Noise> that you introduce yourself say I'm trying to re <Music/Noise> sew in so did you use to live in Cambridge at this address and having confirmed him and said You know I'm working for the Cambridge Somerville you study we'd like to contact you so when everywhere from Maine to Florida to California at least twice a lot of guys when we ask them my asked them why it was they had been up in Arizona or California or whatever May said have you been the summer horrible place a good way to gather it was a little bit like a mystery and you're trying to track people down and every time you found someone that felt like a little treasure hunt she found ninety eight percent of the people from the study it kind of boggles the mind to think either are or how hard she worked or how lucky she got her some combination of both can you explain <Music/Noise> eight is so high it is quite astonishing couple factors working in favor of the first one was that about eighty percent of the participants still residing in Massachusetts at roughly age forty five they were These are one of the fine and I guess probably low income is correlated with low mobility very much still very much so another important part was that Joan began or continued this meticulous record keeping so the last known address last known phone number of these participants so she had started to build in in what we would call today a database she was a compulsive note taker whether it's before Google there was your mom that's exactly right I love the way of thinking about and so for example if we found from talking to a young family member for example that when the subject from the program had died Doctor McCord shouldn't consider the case was closed until she actually had documentation physical documentation we had one guy in particular who his whole family told us that he died a car accident in Canada so for more <Music/Noise> Doctor Cort encourage me to track this guy and I was <Music/Noise> you want Doctor McCord been a real pain the neck years everybody the family home these days you'll be chasing of damaged a ghost she was meticulous she was dog eared and then I had a hunch that maybe I'll try looking at the Motor vehicle records for the state must choose and I found a record of this guy in Massachusetts that was recent and by luck one of the numbers I had a cold and somebody else I'd spoken to answer the phone this time and this person told me that the guy wasn't in fact he was still in Cambridge I actually think I interviewed in a bar and um he's basically said that his family had disowned him from when he went into prison leaked to the soaked McCord and her research assistants tracked down nearly all the participants from the long go study they interviewed the men asking them all sorts of questions about how their lives it turned out nearly every interview and one thing in common their memories <Music/Noise> of the mentoring were overwhelmingly positive you'd get people saying oh it was one of the best things that happened in my lie whatever happened to my mentor and a lot of them made unsolicited comments like If envy for those guys <Music/Noise> NEVER been this person already gone to prison in all kinds of different positive things they attributed back to their council action or experience in addition to the interviews McCord also went after lots of other data on the subjects she got access to all sorts of amazing records and there were a bunch of measures seventy in particular that are worth mentioning death records criminal records mental health records and health records alcoholism and then job satisfaction in marital satisfaction can get that data today presumably unless you hack into insurance database maybe yeah exactly it's available just not legally I'm sure what was her level of you know I guess enthusiasm like at this point when she realizes that she can actually make a comparison and make a measurement about how the treatment where she was clearly animated by the thought that if you can find the causes you're in a better position to find treatments and the vindication of your work is to do that that's what excited her <Music/Noise> by the The Coming up on for comics radio so what did McCord and her intrepid team finally find it was so surprising that began from scratch a second

would think this is going to be a career like this is what you're going to do with your life but that is not what happened no it's it's not I could have gone to been a script supervisor or production quite in a dare associate producer perhaps I'm on the operational side of things and that is what I thought I was reasonably happy doing great I was ecstatic as wonderful and I think because I was very happy at what I was doing with work when I had my down time and I was not at work I didn't have that desperate feeling that you feel when you're like Oh God I'm finally not at work and I just wanna relax I just wanna eat vege out you know so I became creative <Music/Noise> was at home <Music/Noise> had the idea to start making beauty products even occur to you well what initially happened was I'm a huge Prince <Music/Noise> have been for many years and I read an article about him and in that article they talked about how he always smells very good and the reason for it was he kept the assortment of fragrances on his bureau and it was also rumored that he put Chanel Number five in his boots so that whenever he took off his boots he didn't have to worry about his feet not smelling good how I could I could see Princeton the the boat I did love this idea of this blending of fragrances in creating these unique scent that you were thinking about this as a business now do for free you just like just to do for me and that's what I began to do I learned that the way that your fragrance lasts on your body is you layer and so you wash with it you moisturize with it then you spritz and I Then I said Well I don't have which rises that smell like this where my gonna get that and at first I started using lotions that I could get the drug store and I would put fragrances into them and and blend it it didn't work that that wasn't you know ballots from a chemistry perspective so things which is separate and be kind of messy and that led me into looking into possibly making my own and one day I walked into this like new age kind of bookstore and there was a book on essential oils in the art of perfume Marie and in that book were a basic recipes for a massage oil or cream or a bomb so then I thought this is great I can make my own lotions and I know the recipes were very like bare bones and you know they use things like Paris Finland <Music/Noise> which I wasn't to the crazy about using my I wanted to use beeswax and I wanted to find cocoa butter I use the skeleton of the recipes within the book and that I just started adding my own combinations and tweak it you know if something came out runny or too thick or too oily or too stiff flashy you are like literally melting down cocoa butter on stove top and I'm like cooking up things and me using oils together and then seeing what came out yes wow so that's that's a big body butter and a belt a bunch of stuff and mix it together yet I be today you couldn't get Oh go on you to get the DIY videos in and get a good head start but back then it is kind had to figure it out and this was this was like What the the late eighties early nineties that was the late eighties I began selling because I had actually gotten something that you know looked good in work and my mother encouraged me to sell a church flea market in May of ninety three wishing she was saying Hey Lisa the stuff is pretty cat like your You should sell this people might buy and that that is pretty much verbatim what you <Music/Noise> by this is a there you go I did not really Mommy do you think people would pay for this she said yes she said You're butters are good that you know my skin <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> it on my little brothers and sisters and she said I think you should try and I remember saying to my mama says Mom what am I going to put them in because I just would give it to friends and family <Music/Noise> I put in Tupperware or Rubbermaid I found a jar and she said Well we could use recycled baby food jars <Music/Noise> my mom <Music/Noise> my baby sister Torah very recently so she had lots of baby food jars allow and we you <Music/Noise> oil the one the stove like I use to effect either idols back in the day I put the cream in the baby food jars and <Music/Noise> made my labels by hand <Music/Noise> took them out to the flea market and I sold out what you would call that point I call the company Carol's Daughter I did have a name and I called the Carol's Daughter because that's literally who I was my mom was Carol and I was her daughter and the products that I sold I called them frequent moisture butter at the time CU show for this remarkable you are still a writer's assistant on the Cosby Show display this like your weekend side hustle right now by ninety three cars B had ended and I I so I was a freelance person but it was summer TV typically in New York was very slow in the summer months because you're seasons would end in May and your new season wouldn't begin until September so unless you are working on a pile it you are probably off during the summer and that first summer of starting at that flea market at the end of May I spent most of that summer making money selling at different craft fairs and Expos and things like that and I went back to work that fall what did you how much money did you have to put a end to like watch this thing that very first flea market honestly was an investment of one hundred dollars between you know whatever the table rental was in the ingredients that I had to purchase to fill the baby food jars that I had and maybe some flowers to decorate my table and what I did I just kept re investing because I didn't have money that I could say all I'm just going to go pull ten thousand at my savings to start this business so it was something that started in a very small way very organic way and I didn't do anything that I couldn't afford to do so if if someone told me about an expo in Georgia that's fantastic and the fee to get it is only five thousand dollars I wasn't going there but a table you know in Park slope for thirty five bucks okay with the who's who who your customers in that first summer they were mostly African American women that you know we're in the different neighborhoods that I was kinda I did have some customers who weren't African American vote for the most part that's who we come to my table I I was not deliberately saying this is for African American women I was deliberately saying this is for dry skin and subsequently when you have more melanin in your skin that dry skin will show you you look dull feel of the day a year as people say she and you cannot get away from that and that's how I probably at that time ended up with that audience of people who were more frown because they found something that took away that cash so if you if you if you're African American woman in the early nineteen nineties essentially there was a very few options it is really a few companies or serving your needs or wants yes very few there was definitely a community that needed to be served who was not necessarily being served it was it was not something that you could walk into a drugstore and say Look at that this is fantastic great it wasn't there it is now but it wasn't and so that summer of ninety three when you are like selling Body Butter in baby jars at church Lee markets did you think of this is you know as your future just think of this come a fun little side project that I'm doing and I get to hang out with people I know and says I'm having fun at first I thought about it as fine and then August of that summer I was watching an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show yeah and she was talking to people who had started businesses with little or no money and one person said Well you have to know that you're passionate about what you do you can start a business just because you wanna make a bunch of money because it's going to take too long for you to make any money and if you're not passionate about it you went before you make any money and I remember <Music/Noise> I'm really passionate about the <Music/Noise> had like I like doing this and then somebody else said she would define passion as if someone woke you up out of your bed in the middle of the night would you go into this thing and I honestly could answer yes to that question <Music/Noise> who is very fond <Music/Noise> I love a good you know leagues been kind of thing and I realized I would get out of it to do this because I really do enjoy it and I remember sitting on the edge of my bed and saying wait a minute maybe this is the This could be a business and that day was the day that <Music/Noise> this just doesn't have to be a hobby this can be more so that first summer and and you go back to a job and he the hunt and what happens to us to the business to kill it continues to grow people call and say hey hey I've bought a jar cream from you you know let such and such street fair and I'm running out How can I get some more and I would look at my schedule and you know if I'd knew I was going to be home on a Saturday as well if you are to come by my apartment on Saturday I'll be home and working the rest of the week but I'll be home one Saturday what time would you like to come by and that was the beginning of people coming and shopping in my apartment and that continued to grow to the point where sometimes I would come home and asking Massachusetts peak if someone didn't know that it was an actual guest or he'd only heard about it from a friend and you know you're getting your answering machine at home yet so at this point how did you get the word out about Carol's Daughter because initially you were you know yet that the flea markets and people are talking but how did you get more people to know but really you know my my husband calls this The Sister Girl Network it was literally one woman telling another woman and somebody always brought a friend with them and if you brought a friend you know get a free gift or you know something off it was all of that grass roots type of stuff and if I was out selling somewhere and someone asked me about something I didn't know how to make it I figured out how to make it so I learned how to make bath salts I learned how to make body scrubs different types of moisturizers I've figured out how to make shampoo had make conditioner it was it was just experimenting the way you would experiment cooking and when did you decide to leave TV and just do this full time I left television in nineteen ninety six because my son Forrest was due to be born April fifth of that year and I realize that if I continued to work I would basically just give my paycheck to a babysitter yet so it just logically made sense to let the job cull and see if in being at home full time while taking care of a baby could the business grow enough we also at the same time we were able to change how and where we live so on and uncle were selling their home they were selling it to someone else and I think there were three tries at the closing and it just didn't happen and I finally worked up the nerve to ask Is there any way that we could purchase your home and we did it and so Forrest was born March eighteen ninety six and made twenty second of ninety six we moved into the home that we live in today and it enabled us to you know have the space that we needed with the baby but also have space for the business to grow and that was that was a big turning point you know it was a huge difference so many people coming in on Saturdays to shop you know there was a time where you would be like ohh i die in Hi <Music/Noise> Charles and out was like I don't know any of you I never met you before the voice mailbox would fill up every hour and half my husband and I was you know wait to food when did you last checked the phone so I checked it to thirty oh my god it's five o'clock the debt limit let get me a pen and paper and is he just he just look at it in and he can't he can't believe the <Music/Noise> price in just a moment how mention from Oprah crash the company's website guy writing listening to how I built this PR hey

gonna love it you can find wow in the world on Apple podcasts at NPR dot org slash wow or however you get your podcasts the <Music/Noise> in the neck to hide this from NPR guy rise after Lisa started to focus on Carol's Daughter full time the things started to take off pretty fast the what was turning play when did you when did something happen and where you thought Oh my God this is like the time well because I've been in business for twenty four years and because turning points and success and you know those aha moments are very relative and fluid there's been several of those so you know there was there with the moment when my second son Ennis was born and I was in the hospital after having given birth and my husband walks into the hospital with essence magazine and I was in the November issue and I actually had half page article with picture and my name which was a really big deal had they know about it find out about it there but there were beauty editors that lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood where I lived so they were always in search of something different and then because I worked in television production for so long then my husband continue to instill does I would have access to Make Up Artists and Hair stylists and if they you know went by in another production they could reach out to me and I could send it to them I remember hearing that edi Falco loved moisturizer of mine because a makeup artist that I worked with on and show shared it with or you know and I was like ee kay Poh wreath I've never met any valuable to this day but she She loved one of my moisturizer wow so so by nineteen eighty nine you guys were able to open up like an actual shop right yes the first store that was not in my house brick and mortar retail space that had windows and door and the landlord <Music/Noise> wanted the space to be something else and I sent him a gift basket for his wife and a package with the letter about the brand to convince him that's my shop would be great in that location and because of my letter he decided that he was going to give me a shot and he wanted to meet with me to go over the terms so I'm sitting in this meeting feeling so victorious and convince this guy that you know my biz this is what he wants to put in here and he's so he says sell the terms are pretty basic I'm twenty four months deposit on the rent and other level and he's like talking and evenings and quickly adding in my head and I'm like That's fourteen thousand dollars Key that's fourteen thousand The yeah no clue what was going to get fourteen thousand dollars from and it worked out we had some small account set up for our sons for their college and we to get um you know might my boys were very <Music/Noise> you know we took <Music/Noise> between their two accounts I know something like thirty five hundred dollars out of the bank and then one of my on its loan me a little bit more like another four or five thousand dollars yet it worked out it was it was a little little dicey at first but it worked out and I paid my life back before Christmas of that here it's so incredible to hear how thirty five hundred dollars was just excruciating excruciating my money when of course in you know within a decade you were to be doing and tens of millions dollars in sales but at that time it was scary must've felt really scary it was definitely was the thing that that made it palatable was I knew I couldn't stay in the house like I know you're bursting at the seams and you can't accommodate people and your neighbors are starting to look at you like what's going on in there it is all these people that come in out every day we were actually watched at one point for suspicious activity because they're you know alleges ring in the ballon going inside they come out with bags like what school I'm in there and and and we found out later when you know the police officer came to shop and she teaches like I just wanna let you know because it probably didn't know this you owe somebody made a phone call and someone was nervous and eight you know realize that everything was okay and there was nothing untoward going on but yet you just get to a point where you you have to grow up in and you have to take that leap of faith and I didn't want to live in what if I had gotten the store my head what if I just I would rather have had the store fail than to have wondered what c'mon think about that story after story her her name was was in the marquee would she think when she walked in there she she she loved it but but i wld i will tell you the moment that she was like really excited about the business being Carol's Daughter I got to do the Oprah Winfrey Show in two thousand and two and so she got to see that you know to see her daughter on Oprah and all of her friends got to see that and the place where she went where she would get her blood work done on a regular basis was this Medical Center in Brooklyn called the hip Center where she was she sick yes with an illness called Polly my eyesight is so when she came to get her blood work done after that Oprah Winfrey Show all miss Carol was so happy to see you come right and Doctor So and so was waiting for you and then I'm going to take you down to the lab as soon as you're done she's edgy with it at this so fast I was you tell me he said Yeah girl keep going until I can get it hadn't had a Doe provided by you through the magazines and the attention you're getting there getting me on to the shell came through producers and the producers of the show heard about me from another producer who was interviewing for a job she went to Chicago to interview for a position they talked about what they were working on and one of the shows was a show about women who have started businesses in their homes and she said to them will have you spoken to Lisa Price and they reached out to be liked what they heard the interviewed me like six times a week later I was in Chicago taping the show and I was sitting in the audience and she looked at the screen she sees the name of the store and she said Carol's Daughter cows to know Carol's Daughter young camels I had an hour and I'm sitting here like only God knows me and I'm going to die the powder that affect business when oh when it was on Oprah it affected it in an amazing way we had our website go from having thirty seven people it is and within four minutes of my segment the audience in the website went from you know whatever it was thirty something people to seventeen thousand people wow the Web site actually crashed it was remarkable it was just remarkable not anything crazy like not what not what people think that you know one day you're on the show and all of a sudden you're a millionaire and money she's falling out of your hands not that but definitely a significant lift and shift in who knew about us but it was something that was manageable we didn't implode under the pressure so I mean basically folks from the moment you open that first or for the next at least decade you guys are just some of the massive growth trajectory which is like growing and growing and growing every year and opening more stores right what we did open additional stores for very long time I mean I I I wouldn't describe it as a massive growth trajectory there was growth each year but I wouldn't describe it as as massive I didn't open up another store until two thousand and five and in two thousand for I took on a business partner and then in two thousand five we took on investors any case had Simpson big deal and this is like Jay Z was an investor right yes Jay Z Will Smith Jada Pickett Smith and the investment helped us to open up the additional store but also helped us to get into places likes of four A at the time and then subsequently Macy's it helped to build a better infrastructure you know there's there's there's definite excitement and I know pri and everything when you're when you're small and your grassroots a new building but there comes a point you know when you start doing a million a million half to million to a half million in sales where you can wing it you know like things aft to be secure and and that's when investment was definitely needed because they"

I'd say woohoo you which may vary morale and we do sell hamburgers the the two this is the founder of Five Guys burgers and fries J Morrell is seventy three years old and it's been a long journey to get to where he is today he was born in the small mining town in northern Michigan and Jerry says when he was a kid his dad wasn't around that much she was a venture that he wasn't <Music/Noise> family oriented he was a stunt pilot that's probably why <Music/Noise> got a divorce <Music/Noise> went to Catholic <Music/Noise> a kid where <Music/Noise> not the best <Music/Noise> I didn't <Music/Noise> in fact <Music/Noise> some members <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> way Gerri good to get through school and <Music/Noise> to study at the University of Michigan I got scared but my god <Music/Noise> world all the smart people around the fact I was more intimidated after I got to college <Music/Noise> than ever the <Music/Noise> after college Cherry <Music/Noise> back to his hometown <Music/Noise> and he married <Music/Noise> girlfriend to get a job selling life insurance and <Music/Noise> that the marriage didn't last life and of leading <Music/Noise> the kids to Florida and for Jerry was a low point <Music/Noise> kind of floated around <Music/Noise> lived in different cities <Music/Noise> but he's good too with his life <Music/Noise> but he was sure <Music/Noise> thing well one thing washer of the caregiver kits <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> carry into the wide around the mid nineteen seventies Jerry was offered a consulting job in the DC area so he took it and he moved to Alexandria Virginia and that's where he met his second wife Janie and after situation stabilized a bit his kids did actually come to live with them and it was also around that time when Jerry decided to become a financial planner I was shocked at how much money there was in the DC area so some of the back of the financial planning Justin and I got my degree from Bryn Mawr and I started selling financial products to people in the DC area and that's why I didn't see the boys moved in with you all the sudden you've got five people have to fight people right and that was basically what you did you leave or financial planner Financial planner I tried a few businesses I started oil business and taxes so may I did a couple other dumb things I tried to start a water business of all things I thought somebody quarterback and we've been a good idea and they laughed at me and HER TIME IS money is in the early eighties I middle seventies the worst one was oil because I started a company and went down to Texas and found out that they were waiting for me because I was from the East winner take all my money and then when then my wife and I went to the real estate business and knew we were experts at the Bayan real high and then went to a crash and get rid of it so I get this right you were doing financial planning as your <Music/Noise> job that you had like all these business ideas you try it on the side and basically no more right I really didn't know what to do when I was lucky and is likely that that that that I got the hamburger visit the The The The The The The Five Guys be and what was and what adjustments I had a short sighted <Music/Noise> I well I grew up there was a guy name push him up told them we push them up that only had a little tiny hamburger place the ham he had a grill and he didn't so I think September and the ocean Papi the study about the people use the come from all over town to get hamburgers and then when I moved to Washington I saw some I just couldn't believe his Ocean City Maryland and a place <Music/Noise> boardwalk fries place or cost pressures that the spin twenty places so boardwalk fries only one place <Music/Noise> line pressures with one hundred feet long all day long for me and the kids got indoor <Music/Noise> hamburgers <Music/Noise> fries and keep it from the right word and that's <Music/Noise> came from the So what did you do did you did your wife and say Let's try Burger Joint yes which he said the same thing the banks of the time you guys your mind I we we did a little different we said Let's not put a lot of money into it unless find a place where the rent is real all either way nobody can see it and embrace a wide you want to do it that way and we said well if we can put it were it's hard to find but if we can get people come in there and we know we got something and this was in ninety six rate yes so where was the first location clearly apply and libro en Arlington Virginia and it was like a little place and rent was cheap in what was how much money just to put up today with our first or thirty five thousand dollars and wouldn't that cover everything the rent the equipment equipment we found junk equipment rebuilt it ourselves it was a stand up only and Shannon Matt were still in high school and was I think maybe thirteen or something and I said I got some money saved up for college if you want to go to college and um they pretty much said would rather do something else we could go back for second you set your kids down in you had your kid's college fund you said to them Hey look I got this college money I'll send you to college or you cannot go to college and use it to open a burger joint we you mean you can imagine today like a parent saying that to their kids and then other parents saying Your Mortgage in your kids' future on his burger joint yes did you have any of that feeling <Music/Noise> like maybe this is not great no no no I was telling us it was right thing to do probably look back and it was probably a soul was killed was kind of crazy it was crazy that didn't seem crazy to us is for some reason we all seem to be on board with it yet and that now I was really surprised because the kids jumped right in and work tired and Jamie worked on she kept all the books an I was amazed how the kids jumped into it in what is the story with a name had come up that was my lawyer said you should incorporate and you need to have a name as he fills up the papers this was so well thought out that we didn't have a name so me and Jamie and her voice and we had three sons plus one more son would Cheney my fifth son was born yet so his four sons and me so while all five guys for now and then we'll change it through the papers are over with change in colours ok joke <Music/Noise> is like your first day the Opening Day <Music/Noise> six did you get your salad the grand opening and not within the <Music/Noise> first open up that level of fire and the was no business on the recorder twelve <Music/Noise> and one person <Music/Noise> the the thirty where the <Music/Noise> land we made <Music/Noise> very first day we were breaking even <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> right because everybody was in when a couple employees but mostly was kits and we were paying <Music/Noise> time with them some fifteen hours how did you even <Music/Noise> make a burger I mean would you have good home chef was anybody or family good chef lists come from my hometown can't make a burger you can't will we know how to make burgers from where I'm from Posen was right near us and they raise potatoes I grew up in a farm <Music/Noise> to cook potatoes in a new Amber was born yet you knew how to grill a burger and fry potatoes and that's all you really <Music/Noise> that's <Music/Noise> the ingredients from like the potatoes and an analyst of like how did you know how to source the stuff we went to the Thrashers in Ocean City and looked in the potato bags and we found out they came from Rigby Idaho a guy named Rick Miles was small that a deal to actually get a hold of him and we said would you tell us that A is we did not know what the time that he was small now he's become a multimillionaire because we are potatoes from him I was so special about his potatoes they were sold by Thrashers and fifty for youth at eight if there's a line outside this potatoe joint the potatoes must be good be good what was five guys offering at that time was had burgers of all the toppings and all that stuff well we did with the kids Janie and I would not tell the kids how much we're a pain for the product we said whatever pickles you want to put on the hamburgers you guys picked pickles so they would try different brands and different pickles and they'd end up with the most expensive pickles were and we wouldn't say anything about it would say OK that's a pickle you want by those picked by Madison Park first okay then we will buy the most expensive cooking oil you want to cook in and it was pinned on her that's where they cook to Momo society they wanted to buy this bread from the little baker and an arm into it made really good bread brands bakery that had the best bakery in Arlington the time but for a rush of business at the expense and we're paying about seven times for a hamburger bun as McDonald's was and what was ever going for in nineteen eighty six I think were selling some flight three times four times a McDonald's with some for which your body so we are crazy would make it that way but we didn't let the kids know how much we're paying for any food so they would just go out there and whatever was left a like it that's way it was and was the thinking behind that strategy of thinking was that they're going to pick the best product they can pick what the customer likes what they like giving an example <Music/Noise> it is the kids liked a certain kind of mania because it was there with the whole thing together <Music/Noise> were buying <Music/Noise> time from guy up in New York <Music/Noise> hard to get along with and <Music/Noise> our first purchasing <Music/Noise> he should is no way that may need to support <Music/Noise> no way this guy was <Music/Noise> so we had all the family <Music/Noise> a blind <Music/Noise> eats to the end to this day I can be managed by itself <Music/Noise> like nine different dishes <Music/Noise> technical school and everybody would finish the maze blindfolded <Music/Noise> improve if you can't <Music/Noise> difference in this <Music/Noise> after the Abuja blindfold off my wife myself and all the boys picked the same <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the door <Music/Noise> game and <Music/Noise> it at the end of the month we look at the sales and then we look at how much we paid for the food in which a We got a razor price the kids to know why raise the prices but we would always say food costs and stay around thirty percent whatever we got to do to raise prices raise prices and which we have to worry about price we don't want to be in this business ok so you've got this first burger joint right and again had impaired people find out about people even know about the only way would be somebody else tell them they said there's this great burger places little like walk up shake it a try it that's the only way they would have found out about it there was a place in DC when I first moved to an office downtown at lunch or breakfast but was downstairs and was an alley and was not allowed or for member right to steel door come off the alley but all offices around there we go to this place and that was on Martin was an alley and was always impressed with the fact that that guy could do that much business of mine whom I knew much money was made to the soul that within three months it was gone the people were going there for the food was working and she was active back I can do that would just open up a corner and people like us felt calm if they don't like is they won't <Music/Noise> in the biz in <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> five guys didn't stay <Music/Noise> and how they grew way beyond Virginia even though the last person who wanted to do that has cherry

Virginia the first people knew about it through word of mouth of course eventually newspaper started to write about the burgers and then the Lions started to get longer so Jerry and his family started to think about opening a second location that they needed the money to finance it but remember going in the bank and the do what I saw no food hamburger place that we just laughed at us but that summation Holmes said we got friends that their parents got a little bit of money and they know Five Guys is doing good maybe blast them for for a few thousand so we had eventually at about one hundred and fifty two hundred people that would be blowing any one time to give us money but not as investors just for loans we did a different way we did as investors would say five thousand hours will give you a certain percentage of the growths not never thought profit as it was always too many ways to get cheap people that way so I said will give a certain percentage of Gross will give you the money every single morning and anytime you want your money back you can have an air base about that stupid bigoted a blip was going to Mass for the money back but my method to my madness was also that I should do them any time and pay you back I came to someday have this thing was successful I will get better financing might go back to the people and pay him back into Milan and say you never gave them to they were equity owners Matt no real sense we just made a note said at the store does twenty thousand week you get certain percentage every week and we gave the money exactly on time every month so that we could always go back now for more money so how much money as you do raise for to do store number to offer store number two we probably only had a raise maybe a hundred and fifty thousand but we had we had a lot of people just want to throw money at a sale like the burgers are doing what they like the fact that we're making money and they're getting paid every month I had a bow seventy five people I didn't even know on that list and ISIS is everyone and don't put your money and somebody else's business and which is a lot of people saw some and five guys were you fully committed to this or did you leave no building financial plan on financing plan was and what point do you say to your kids your wife you know I'm going to give up my job and I'm going to focus on Five Guys full time well that was almost the day I got hit in the head with a broom I must have a bad day at the office of home and <Music/Noise> is that my wife I quit and she said You gotta Be Crazy Mom I'm dumb I'm going to work anymore I'm just going to concentrate on the burger business and she was pretty upset because she thought this is too risky yes and the U I think we can make this work well I just I thought it was fun guess I was still my kids I said You don't have to be in this business if you want to be make sure it's fun pics you like to do in the biz us the okay so now it was like the entire family focusing full time in five guys the what what great goals inevitably play well <Music/Noise> Cheney is like a general she is very <Music/Noise> runs off of <Music/Noise> my kids were able to go to investors <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> wasn't for them my <Music/Noise> all five guys I didn't go far to get the dishes sit <Music/Noise> this thing <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> believe that the <Music/Noise> ideas they pretend they <Music/Noise> so I have lived in the wash <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> know driving to Virginia in like nineteen ninety <Music/Noise> five guys <Music/Noise> when it was still just <Music/Noise> right locations two thousand to April two thousand to <Music/Noise> good to five jobs <Music/Noise> and were you doing pretty well <Music/Noise> making a decent living at that point because must enrich know you were but the <Music/Noise> is we had figured out the nuts and bolts of the most franchise years start off the franchise we didn't start off the franchise we had no idea we're going to do that we started off to build a family business and we put seventeen years into it when we figured out how to do it right yet so it came time to franchise him and we had a perfect system had you been at that point say you hate lets franchise let's build this thing out of my sons came to me about the nineteen late in the late nineteen ninety and started trying to convince me that franchise and I was dead set against it really dead set against it because I didn't think there's any way I could convince other people to do or don't have the change of mind well there was a guy named Mark Moseley was selling franchises for another company he been watching Five Guys for wow and my kids got me to meet with them I don't want to do it in fact they bought me a book called franchise in for Dummies it was written by Dave Thomas oh they get from Wendy's yes okay so <Music/Noise> that and I the legal stuff it was amazing all the rules how to fall in everything arm so when they talk me into it why didn't she want to do it because if or when you start franchising first of all time franchise either not to worry about food costs are pretty pretty stupid unit on franchisee that you're not going to advertise ourselves pretty stupid even Tommy only going to sew hamburgers and french fries it's all going to say when we got to be open later we get to sell alcohol only got to watch food cos we gotta shop around for our products and don't do that night and I get by we buy from people who will stick with them that was all hard to sell to franchisees but we got through that and I remember Mark Kamen he was going to our salesman we he should show a camera Amish stores the first year the shelf in the butt I should not discuss that and the South fifteen to twenty five and I think within that <Music/Noise> of the two years we sold thirty five hundred the show <Music/Noise> States The Who The awakening your burgers were still a lot <Music/Noise> expensive <Music/Noise> for absolutely <Music/Noise> took a lot lot lot longer to get a burger that really cute at least it's not snow takes longer to get a burger so the business model is different so are you worried Egypt or think maybe this works another Virginia but I'm not sure this is going to work somewhere else absolutely scared the heck out of us were talking about the long wait the staff assigned the first orders that said if you're in a hurry there are a lot of really good burger places near here Omar can put that out and help yeah I remember the first franchise store we opened up was in Richmond oh my god Richmond nobody you know we are in Richmond I couldn't sleep the night before Richmond that slide down the road ninety miles it's not often but I couldn't even sleep nobody's going <Music/Noise> rich miss toh was successful and then they said was never going to go to North Carolina and South to know when those who have known there was no way we're going to Florida because people never buy that product in Florida to their older people and Florida to get a hundred stores in Florida shown me the idea of going from five stores in two thousand to two thousands of stores within a year to year we didn't go to thousands of stores which sold franchises those are still being built out in the United States we've got about fourteen honor of them built our now with all the territory the United States is gone was that just mind boggling mind boggling mind going and I was I was so proud of my kids that didn't go to their head they're still my kids they work just like the use of a work hard every day what does it mean what's it like to work with your five sons and in your life I mean they're all involved to come and what did each do a different thing for the company while I have one son that just loves doing stuff in the stores like make sure the paint dry and decorated dry and he's really into that so that's his job that's what he does mostly the ones a fanatic about the food and so he goes around the world put nine shows them how to cook things right stuff and another son that he's really into the financing part of the graph that mean I'm glad because I'm <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> spaces international fine everybody's kind of found their <Music/Noise> we grandkids four grandkids work in the business <Music/Noise> some I teach him some <Music/Noise> filled in one of them she loves taking care of making sure there's no food or new shoes <Music/Noise> she <Music/Noise> and I don't find what they want to find and capture can be filled by them to hire somebody is your family still the primary owner of the company yes we own about seventy five percent are coming to my family but we took in a fairly big investor first our franchise and they don't interfere in our business at all they gave us a big chunk of money from their entrepreneurs to and they saw someone find guys what percentage of the actual restaurants team has owned as a design window of a of about fourteen fifteen hundred restaurants we have a joint venture in Great Britain and France and Germany <Music/Noise> with our partner half that about sixty stores and then over here we own about four hundred and fifty of the fourteen hundred Hemi country's total is five days in now where in Great Britain which I guess it's the one country for now the UK and now we've got sixty stores there were two in France we just opened up and downs that was a storm Madrid we got several stores in the Middle East and so I think a lot of people in the little bit successful they look back and trying to figure out how they did it I can't figure out though <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> it was like bah my God yeah <Music/Noise> two things a lot of credit <Music/Noise> a great believer in <Music/Noise> intuition <Music/Noise> or a Higher <Music/Noise> God or whatever you wanna call it a great believer in listening to my hunch is <Music/Noise> and <Music/Noise> I could of <Music/Noise> for sure my kids I am lucky and got my kids my wife does this seems to me without them nothing <Music/Noise> but the We were lucky though again real real long do you really are vision <Music/Noise> to open up a burger joint vision was to get kids to live with you <Music/Noise> life divorced which that was here I guess that was a real success getting your kids things <Music/Noise> yeah the best <Music/Noise> my light kit <Music/Noise> the best thing that's happened to her mother which is my ex wife is the fact that they're able to do all kinds of wonderful things for ya oh and you still have a relationship with her well my my current wife we know she's benefited from me or the success of your sons to do how did being financially stable and set had to change a life or be able to do things that you couldn't do before well most people than I know I've known since about a kid when I started five guys I let three or four my buddies and went to highschool with buys stock in my company because I thought it would be a great thing for them they didn't have money little bit low but the moment it much and one of my loan the money"

the the the grown so fast we had TV go in we have started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of stuff and we wear and the middle of that when <Music/Noise> happened and of course people stopped traveling and travel guides and just stopped did you think that there was a possibility that the whole thing would collapse yes we did have to let people go we did have to remember books we did and I honestly <Music/Noise> that <Music/Noise> to disappear <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> the the yard it's how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists <Music/Noise> behind the movements they built <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> had Tony <Music/Noise> backpack the long Asia hippie trail <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> jotted down some notes and turn them into the travel guide company in the world so much of how a company comes together happens Nigel hands the Baton of Sir J Brennan Larry Page never met and would there be Google if Kate and Andy spade and never work in the same clothing store in Tucson Arizona and would the Kate spade bags had been the same thing for every envy or Instagram where B Parker they all have and because of a chance meeting just a moment in time that could have passed which is the story of lonely Planet guidebooks because it all started on a bench in regions Park in London over afternoon in nineteen seventy Maureen Wheeler was just looking for a quiet place to sit and read I was walking around the park that was only one vests that had some and I will try several times because among the banks is also young man I thought if I sit not when she's trying to pick me up and I really don't feel like that so I woke up few times and I thought dammit this is nineteen seventy I consider <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> a sunny bench and turned my back to the young man and started reading my book we didn't know it it's appalling <Music/Noise> comic is a <Music/Noise> of it and I was just reading that when this <Music/Noise> came on set and started reading Tolstoy the twenty two <Music/Noise> I said Is this the in place to read on a Thursday afternoon and she replied to your reply positively I turned around looked at him as of right to say get lost and and and he's got nice eyes and I liked him so I said I don't know I haven't been here that long we started chatting and after a while Tony Astoria if she wanted to see a movie so they went and I'm on the way home we got lost and we wandered around for quite awhile for I realize these laws because honey just said softly confidently and keeps going thinking he's going off the right direction and the thing is that's been our entire lives together anyway that first eight led to a second and then into a third and then twelve months the day later we got married and Chinese proposal was very very safely was it was Mei Mei and he said I would have no new <Music/Noise> on October the seventh and he says you get married and I said you don't get married because you've known each other for a year and she said no but we would save tax I know I was a business school so that's my excuse for that I'm afraid it was in the most romantic so when she got married did would you think you just get jobs in London <Music/Noise> lives that was pretty much the plan <Music/Noise> we met just the start of my two year course <Music/Noise> and we got <Music/Noise> through that <Music/Noise> the son sometime in that second year together we decided we were going to take a year off and traveling <Music/Noise> certainly changed things how did you guys make that decision what was the conversation yet I don't know if I was very much a thing to do that here I mean later on they started calling it the hippie trail we just called it the Asia Overland trip that you you left London <Music/Noise> east but this was the airing of the music of the time was writing the Marrakech Express from the Beatles are often in <Music/Noise> of sort of cultural significance to it but we joined what became known as the hippie trial <Music/Noise> headed east so this is I guess around nineteen seventy two ish and what was the plan the plan was to drive from London to wherever to wherever I feel that the county for this card it was so cheap that we thought what if it breaks down will get out of it only by the road we were going to go as far east as we could go head to dispose it would break down with selling one of the other social us set out anyone like me to start writing to Europe and then and just keep driving it is he going to the ego at the border with check in around the new Red Cross around you go right across church at Afghanistan and then we just keep things in Pakistan and UK through India <Music/Noise> you couldn't get across had to fly across Burma and then we just carry on the plan <Music/Noise> to get to Australia and then we would stay in Australia and work for a while and would save up enough money and would fly back to London <Music/Noise> the plan we had so little money we left London with four hundred pounds so that was our money and you just stayed like slept in the van we did at times but generally we camped most the time across Asia into a gritty achieve in Afghanistan in Afghanistan <Music/Noise> hotels in those days that being gardens and you could camp in the garden at that time why did you even <Music/Noise> where to go and what to do and how to get the right bus I mean haven't you figure all that stuff out it's not that hard I mean if you look in da bus station in Afghanistan and a kind of pointing towards the border somebody will put you on the right bus you know <Music/Noise> if you're wondering <Music/Noise> with the bag <Music/Noise> looking to know that he would like to look <Music/Noise> will point you towards a hotel you'll see something that looks like a hotel you know you're in a restaurant you will for the ads it's not it's easy easy today because you just <Music/Noise> but I'm talking nineteen seventy till right at me there was <Music/Noise> really ever <Music/Noise> and actually you know what what was great is that you could travel for weeks without saying another Weston but then suddenly a pile and some are like Kabul <Music/Noise> to our hair up and the others and you just spent the afternoon just trading information in it when you get here this place is good this place isn't useful information that way this is like old fashioned communication and what I call all along you are keeping a journal Tony are both you guys are I did keep a diary <Music/Noise> being reason to be deciduous about documenting things and keeping records of things but what you write down all just where we stayed <Music/Noise> cost and how many miles the car that day and now I think about the palace <Music/Noise> in the fortress is you know those things are just as important but those days it was very much the information <Music/Noise> which costs could think that's what we were later <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> and presumably particular to know this is like next to no <Music/Noise> yet know we had to do everything as cheaply as possible so it was our class rail and it was hitchhiking we hitch hike from Bangkok all away to Singapore to get down that the women to cross by boat to Jakarta and then we went by bus to Bali and Bali were really run out of luck the island that was supposed to though theirs was to have tickets on to take is to stray a broke down and didn't have any war planes and sew them we met this new Zealander had lately often he was looking for crew to get down to Australia so Lou we got on his yacht Anchorage a strata was at like scary at all anytime I think I got really <Music/Noise> huge storm in the boat and if I'd had more sensitive than terrified but they're so busy hanging onto the boat and then the thinking goes astray <Music/Noise> standing on the OT looking at this coastline and nothing on it nothing at all would come in and places miles from anywhere and there was nothing I have another snakes or spiders in all kind of Gee <Music/Noise> what I'm doing here what did you think you would do that you think he would hang out there for awhile because neither of you had any connections in Australia right now we went to Sydney Festival in Michigan to go to Australia Sydney is the golden city that you will head towards the yellow brick road leads that after crossing the bridge on our last ride and I said and it was not long after Christmas so it was quite close to holidays I said to Tony how much money have we got left and the Buddha's Hands document he said he got twenty seven cents bicycle how the English may not much so what did you do like how did you even had a camera so <Music/Noise> went to the area of Sydney way you dispose of the sort of things alone shop and we got twenty five dollars for my camera which I bought back a week later than twenty five dollars and in those days you get a room for a week for fifteen dollars <Music/Noise> we <Music/Noise> with a single bad guy that is those day than a communal kitchen and bathroom newlyweds you know from and take the stage we were married <Music/Noise> two years now with your dad felt like we'd known eachother for two years I got a job again that afternoon instantly and the little kind of corner shop but they did sandwiches and things and the end of the day let me take some of his home that were left so we ate and I worked there for awhile until Lee and Amy posts you know got good jobs one year trip and now become a three year trip so what did you what kind of judging attorney I got of marketing job for a pharmaceutical company Maureen you're working a job another was debuting city as a P A <Music/Noise> company you're working for a wine company how do you get to a point where you're you start selling a travel book well the heat was all the great ideas like it's from around the world and lets the guidebooks I mean I was Satan is the architect and the Carpenter C said look we should do a book on the radio that this was after we met so many people every time we went to some sort of party all met friends at restaurants and so on always someone would ask us Where did you go <Music/Noise> this there was a lot of interest in the sort of trip we did after awhile we thought hey we could just telling <Music/Noise> things down and will actually make the information down in the form of a Balkan summit and I I was working said in an office was able to get my typewriter and bring <Music/Noise> and from a bar of the guillotine when we were dreaming all the books and one of those masses papers stapled together so anyway <Music/Noise> kind of the Jews were able to get enough equipment to do this we had it printed but it was Sam is a very basic that it was a very it was actually done <Music/Noise> was done in our kitchen table the collection really had a kitchen kitchen a bedroom so and then you take it to a printer and you ran off copies of it we found the little that we didn't get a big commercial printer was a tie at this point <Music/Noise> the basement <Music/Noise> and he printed them for us but we just part of the pages we actually voted them put them together is Maureen says stapled them and trimmed the edges the guillotine a hernia home produced book but one that they were finished and although we had them in boxes at our apartment I took a day off work and I went straight to the bookshop that said buy fifty copies of it and said Okay here I am right medio de vino at the end of the day I'd sold a surprising <Music/Noise> what was a price or eighty calorie So for those ninety six pages that sold for one dollar eighty and the cover all the countries you went through full of all <Music/Noise> six very brief but I went in to what we got her big break as Ava's I went into a bookshop and she said message wanna buy this book and he said so accompany us and I said Loney patches that have never heard of them and I said no you wouldn't and I showed her the book in time she saw what your telephone number in case I want to get the book so we didn't have a telephone in hand so I had given my work number and she called me and she said um my flatmate is a journalist and she wants to interview you and your husband on TV so we went on television talk about our trip and in this book and that was our first big publicity things and yet I was out I was reading to your first guide with a pan flat and it's in there there's some pretty different things in there I like Amy McGee tells you where you can find marijuana <Music/Noise> hard to find where to get a fake ID and stuff like that right I think I still think student cards they were very popular still on some places I have to assume that you you know you guys could not have been like stoned hippies because you're motivated to write everyday and to go places and to cattle are actually really boring we didn't do a lot of that stuff will occasionally but very rarely in fact it was years later I was lonely planet became better known all these people who are using on the planet you know and what they were really cool people in school people used on the planet and Tony and I would be at the cafe and all the cool people but we just didn't look old and yet we were the ones for the work yet so it sit there quietly while the holding of the cooler and doesn't think ugh ugh this is interesting and had you come up with with with the name lonely Planet I know there's a story behind that we got the book ton of headway at everything that a title for it is across Asia on the cheek we didn't have a title for the publishing <Music/Noise> for the publishing house and we've been at a restaurant and thinking too much red wine and we just been to <Music/Noise> rock'n'roll band on the road film Mad Dogs and Englishman whose Joe Cocker and Leon Russell traveling around <Music/Noise> in the late sixties Trek film one <Music/Noise> that that that movie and that Ms Joe Cocker singing a song called Space Captain and the first line of the song goes once while traveling across the sky this lonely Planet caught my eye on the <Music/Noise> the the the <Music/Noise> most it to Moreno was humming the song has such nice weather we call the company lonely Planet sphere to which Maureen said actually the first lines lovely play and I wish he would stop singing and an esa Colonia kind it's even better is that how we said well just sense the SOS ok it's a great day and is a great song for us is one unit <Music/Noise> to live together on this planet is going <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> so do the first book of like make any money not much that has not started covering the cost of the print I didn't lose money on it but it wasn't a real money making proposition but around that time and we were thinking of the Okay this is when we quit and head back to Europe then we began to think that has sold surprisingly <Music/Noise> maybe we should do another book and what we thought was towards the end of the trip from London with cum dancer Southeast Asia because of that time the Vietnam War was still winding <Music/Noise> so Southeast Asia wasn't seen as a hotspot for a holiday it was a was a place next to was an but we could see that was about to change we thought okay well do as we travel around South East Asia and will write the best book anybody's ever seen in Southeast Asia we had a Yamaha trail bike that was our transport and at this point Tony did you think this is I think this is what we're going to do no I still think you know we we realize we sort of found a sweet spot we found we were doing something that people really liked but you know one of the things I've said a lot <Music/Noise> it was like Yo dot com or via social media set up these days they start on <Music/Noise> and week later they're worth a billion dollars that was not subtle we did our business grew very <Music/Noise> and I think it was it was more like a snowball rolling <Music/Noise> gotta keep pushing it at first and then it starts to develop momentum starts to get larger as it broke down the hill the the the <Music/Noise> land we come back as Tony <Music/Noise> grew lonely Planet and then shrink it and then <Music/Noise> almost lost it and I rise here listening to how I built this from

the the the <Music/Noise> welcome back to high buildings from NPR guy Russ and so in nineteen seventy three Tony <Music/Noise> were traveling around Southeast Asia once again and they were doing research for their second lonely Planet book <Music/Noise> but it was just about finished I had a dummy of the book there was one big book shop in Singapore I got a appointment with the buyer for that book shop I thought to myself you know he'll definitely certain buy ten copies and if I'm lucky like twenty or fifty you listen to my spiel denied my tummy of the book I saw him riding Southeast Asia on a shoestring and me on the order form and invite some numb but at least on the <Music/Noise> did push across the destiny of thousand copies I know I walked out of that that office a foot above the ground and re spec to the hotel and its mores which sold twenty percent of opera and one bookshop fantastic Chafee saw the success of that but what I mean what was your next move we did another one to one another when people started coming to us with ideas for other books and Maureen did you think I mean Sosa by the mid seventies or late seventies Eve and did you still did you think that this was going to be your work I mean did you did you both kind of focus fulltime on this thing now pretty much although I was at university that I have plenty of time after the first year the only planet in the Nob and you are a full time job <Music/Noise> you more in <Music/Noise> worked on the books I didn't think it was going to be our life I couldn't say how could it was still Tony and I living in a little rented house with a pile of boxes boxes everywhere full of books and when we know we wrap them with address them and put them in the back of the car and taken to the post office I mean you don't really see a multinational conglomerate I did this and I was still going down to the docks to pick the books up when they came in from the printer and then sending them out again you know it still felt like very much like a cottage industry you know and it was like un raised any money or just give us any money basically if you told a bank and what we're doing books on that say Get a Life wasn't really why we didn't have any money and the work making a lot of money but we're making enough to keep on doing books but we did find other people were coming to us today used the book and say You know I've really liked your book traveling around Southeast Asia I've been living in South America you know I could write a book about this place of the place so we we started getting other people coming to us with similar <Music/Noise> and really by the end <Music/Noise> get about twenty books yet but with a turning point what was the book that like all the sudden where you thought OK this is our breakthrough lot of good it was very <Music/Noise> the balloons and we did a book on India we researched out in <Music/Noise> eighty this was the first time we've been able to put a team into a place of more <Music/Noise> email me at two other riders we divided the country up north to south the middle and I found out I was pregnant just the week before I flew to India for this five month trek around India House you're pregnant traveling in India and would just like that like stuffing pamphlets and brochures and notes into backpacks yes very much say anything else something that we also collect every brochure every time table every math I mainly go was hardly anything in Iraq sex and come back with his massive pile of information of stuff yet much easier these days we put all my memory stick and suddenly we had this book that was over seven hundred pages and it sold for double figures as twelve dollars or fourteen dollars or something instead of three or four and it just sold its always the one hundred thousand copies of how it was the first All India book of that kind of guy that told you everything and there but it wasn't a book like that but that was all of the huge interest in India at the time you know so it just took right off the company doubled in size overnight and we suddenly started taking on more riders and looking at other big projects and and you had a baby at this point yes I said What did you do have a juicer we took away the sewing when she was held this time she went to India to India to Malaysia and she was eight months yet so we dragged our eight month old daughter ran with us I have two children and every school holiday with witches go Africa or Asia or wherever and a travel with us for that period of time every time we got a chance we'd go and try was a family but mainly when he was doing the writing and this was the timing and all that and I was doing the carpentry and keeping it together yet how it actually moved out of the House met a real office moved into a kind of ramshackle office we had a lot of kind of lose contractors and flowed in amount of inflow data can and we pay them by the outsourcing so it was beginning to take shape in the eighties as a real business when what point did you stop having sleepless nights about whether you are going to be sustainable I know I had sleeve had sleepless nights all every year I would say actually towards late eighties early nineties I think was more when it became obvious at this thing has its own momentum and it was carrying us as much as we were pushing it and I've talked to people who are doing the hand in the publishing LP at that time and they said it just seemed like we couldn't do anything wrong that every book we did you know <Music/Noise> and I think we studied in Europe guys because we were this little publisher or the other end of the world who'd started off doing Asia how many finally did get around to doing Europe we were big enough by that point we could really do it well and I think people in the office really got a kick out of that that it was such a thrill doing that and sort of you know going out and taking on anybody in the world wanted to try and compete with us I mean people everywhere you went for using any kind of guides to give me a thrill you know in a New York seeing someone come in with the German copy of Chinese copy or you know whatever adjust I used to love that the But when the whether every moments where it wasn't going well room of the was a period when things were not looking very good and I have a knitter and two thousand and eight he had grown so fast and reached a point were doing so much we had TV going we have started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of staff a lot of you know we've created a whole lot of desktop publishing before it was even a term of a lot of money that books are still selling like crazy that we were just doing so much and we wear and the middle of that when nine eleven happened and of course people stopped traveling and travel guides and just stop did you think that there was a possibility that the whole thing with class yes I I definitely like I did not know the reasoning for the optimist I mean and that's one of his charms but it's also one of the most infuriating things because we were definitely looking and had a really bad time with her looking at we did have to let people go out we did have to cut back on our offices overseas we did have to compact the number of books we did and it was looking I honestly didn't believe that that was possible the whole thing to say in retrospect I think Maureen few of us much more accurate than mine we really had to pull start putting everything together and we did cut back and make it a much more efficient business owner to turn around it a couple years to turn round I guess it was around and around that time I guess in the mid two thousand <Music/Noise> you wound up selling the company right yes I think we both felt that it wasn't the same company anymore it was it was turning into much more of a digital company and that has a way of taking over everything it's not something I'm particularly excited about we we really felt it was time not and it was new to be a dentist who work in hand onto our kids the kids are both worked in the company at one stage but neither of them are going to take over from us and we just had to feel it was time to move on to something else and I mean can't you feel great"

efficiency in cars Coke employees accept and tackle life's big challenges head on see how a K O C H challenge dot com then <Music/Noise> we made <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I was sick about <Music/Noise> in fifty years of great <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> stuff and <Music/Noise> judgment <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> but <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> from NPR it's how I felt the show the innovators <Music/Noise> feel it's <Music/Noise> behind the movement <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> in on Today Show Young <Music/Noise> sex drugs and rock'n'roll packaged <Music/Noise> most iconic magazines <Music/Noise> and built a publishing empire <Music/Noise> the scene you probably notice about the people who get on the show is the All Sun opportunity and they took it sure that was locked it was hard work failure persistence all that but the difference between say a Sara Blakely hand the rest of us is that in the nineteen nineties she saw an opportunity to improve women's undergarments and she sees did ride canyons on opening to make better personal computers in the nineteen eighty so he built compact and for yon where he was also in the right place at the right time in the nineteen sixties he was a student journalist at UC Berkeley right at the time <Music/Noise> is going to bury our becoming the center of youth culture in America <Music/Noise> but just being there wasn't enough what John Leonard did was to capture the moment to take that energy and create a gathering place for Young People magazine that spoke to them in their language terms of the small small town yet not all a little off to be me get the <Music/Noise> time is that beautiful picturesque town which was very tolerant of social behavior that was a little off the center and the arts community service of proceeding Iraq mall scene and hippies especially with the bead gem air Falcons bring Karo act of throwing Getty and they all found a home and seven Cisco as the people like Lenny Bruce so it had a thriving beat NEC alternative lifestyle community and so therefore was extremely tolerant of the rock'n'roll groups are springing up where even weirder than the BX and coffeehouse scene as consistent Sam's long history of being tolerant of all kinds of political movements artistically it's interesting because a question live a pretty strong students at Columbia and in Boston that Miss M Jusco Berkeley that was the center of of student activism in America arguably in the world at the time I think so yeah I'm a clumsy came several years after nineteen sixty eight so I think I really started this as the Bay Area was coming by very early days of civil rights homes or losses were going off on marches down south and artists manos kind of thing so I think Levi has them among students really was generated in excess of the Bay Area was an exciting exciting time oh yeah I mean because you know the full commitment and passion sense of possibility in the postwar baby boom just trying to come of age son become college students and sensing that day it was their turn on stage as their right or responsibility to try and make America stand up for deeper and behave in such a way as they were we were taught in school America's ideals were about every life every pursuit of happiness to me in how you met Ralph Gleason because he would of course a figure very prominently in the founding story of Toby who was he and Adam Moore Ralph Gleason was a jazz columnist for the services of Chronicle edition coverage as he would buy about some rocker moldings Dylan Beatles Stones and he was on the few voices around anymore to come GL and seven Cisco that the saying Hey there's real merit to these artist Adele and deals Monday doing is important is important as culture in point so as a rock roll fan I'd read that has three times a week column so he was somebody you pay close attention and I met him at a rock roll show and Sam Sisk I think once the militia was called a tribute to Doctor Strange and you just went to him and said Hey M Young winner yes I did many said I know you I've been reading your column it's funny how blown away that this famous <Music/Noise> was I sure wasn't because I can pardon all my column after so we chatted slacked and then suddenly a medic of more times we had lunch some like data caps each other dance and became buddies <Music/Noise> also I got since I was his take me under his wing <Music/Noise> he likewise doing coz price can to ensure the company how much older was he that you <Music/Noise> I was probably twenty of the time he's forty so he's an adult you are and at what point did you say to him hate loudest or magazine together which the store had a very even and the conversation begin well he kind of looked after my career I admit I was after in the summer of sixty five I was in London living there as wild eyed kid I came back the state is looking for jobs and we knew of anything and he said he did there was something available think something ramparts magazine and stepsister when <Music/Noise> up <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> ramparts Magazine <Music/Noise> very left wing kind <Music/Noise> journalism magazine as in charge of that tender age of the arts entertainment comfort which doesn't charge me heavily towards rock'n'roll hippie culture so can sae much of the stuff that would end up in rollers don't have an after that job ran out about nine months later I was kind of loss what to do I was twenty years old at time of twenty one and no career training <Music/Noise> job prospects this is digital digital back to Ralph for help well we're very we're big fans as I was looking to Ralph for career advice and guidance or something to do with him since we're so it's a paddock and sank about who he saw the world and we tried a couple of different ideas he added The Book Book two anthology something center around music and I guess he either here I said Why don't we start a publication about and I was a high bar to get or below barman was a Canadian newspaper on newsprint sewing me a full scale magazine launch and was going to be focused on rock'n'roll on Raw was or anything like that in nineteen sixty seven nothing like that so help me understand this and this guy roughly sand a notable well respected jazz critic this have to chronicle young man the middle aged has enough confidence in a twenty one year old kid to say yes to start a rock and roll magazine with you and it does sound implausible now doesn't it the I don't know I mean we got along really well and we share the same vision and he had when he was young star publication called Jazz quarterly which was so mean some of the same fans magazine about that match as so I think he probably saw in me <Music/Noise> version of himself how he saw the possibilities he saw that I had some high level of talent ambition it might be able to bring something off he even gave me money for what was the ambition did you guess it and say we're going to make the base magazine in America I know I mean I don't know if we knew it because Maisie in America was but that was by the ambition ambition was to do something that was new and fresh about music and whatnot was <Music/Noise> dance time to start to have some very serious little content and social economy these were people start to articulate a <Music/Noise> rebellious stance toward society they were <Music/Noise> concerned about is writing a lot about alienation <Music/Noise> a good deal for writing a lot about social mores and how people should be treated this way things are beginning to resonate deeply with a new young generation which I was on the <Music/Noise> of the Ralph says OK let's let's do this he has a little cash to put and yet some cash but then I cut from the <Music/Noise> two thousand my mother <Music/Noise> other a lot to be <Music/Noise> some money from a college friend <Music/Noise> and also for my step and that the assembled together was seventy five hundred dollars <Music/Noise> of the the <Music/Noise> who and what I mean what did you do from that point did you assemble a staff did you start to write articles that you've to find a place that was going to print is big because he's starting today you could spur on line but then finding a printer and that's expensive it's an expensive proposition might distribute well yeah I was all calm and not too expensive but we need to find offices so we went in the printer that we had used it Sunday ramparts agreed to give us offices upstairs playing facility since we're going to print the magazine that we assembled friends of mine people I met ramparts of people in Berkeley or other people write about the rock will see the small to volunteer their efforts write articles and take pictures or put it together so it was really a volunteer effort and as you come up with the name on the rattle of names the one that kept sticking with Rolling Stone that don't song Like a Rolling Stone and tile an essay that Ralph had written for a small publication called The American scholar she laid out his thinking about the meaning of rock on what's important and <Music/Noise> developing American society and just walk me through this in nineteen sixty seven I mean because today of course there's lawyers in their zealous seasons and documents of incorporation and there's equity splits did you have to do any of that was just fly by the sheep at the pharmacy the pants mean nothing about magazine publishing and distribution out of a gun or saying what editorial wasn't much of the like and you had a right or experience at the record companies and it was just the right out in December the the <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> the I mean you are creating business did you had you even <Music/Noise> where to start I had no not you know we just we pay we could pay for the Miley had a man that would be as far as ego and says We're paying salaries or paying rent are only cos really was printing the paper and the cost of decisions which I was even aware of until two or three months later and all these fucking bills kept coming yeah oh my god so from the time that you raise that seventy five hundred dollars to the time the first issue came out was how long will it take about three months two months that's fast fast are Peter and and so what was that to me but the first issue was when John was on the cover photo of him as private between <Music/Noise> How I won the war and neck and actually I'm not that we send out somebody take <Music/Noise> but just whatever free publicity photographs were flying <Music/Noise> we're looking for something and there was a package of of the pictures that Moose is coming a mistake that John and trust that <Music/Noise> intended to be brilliant when looking back at the choice of John <Music/Noise> our first issue is more than <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> reviews <Music/Noise> and seven Cisco was there the colors chosen the big thing must be the day investigation into what <Music/Noise> to them I have been hard at the Monterey <Music/Noise> been given to charity or not that long for <Music/Noise> kind of stepped right into a traditional job <Music/Noise> so tell me about just getting the articles in the deadlines we would eat with your new riders going out and and making deadlines and are you working round the clock to get this thing out was it a weekly monthly as every other movie had very few writers as very hard to push them to heart all volunteer not paying anybody to ask him things but everyone is like in view the same spirit enthusiasm for and people really pitched in and and and we are able to get that thing out every two weeks without fail from then on how silly you despite the fact the you are in this are the center of the sex drugs rock'n'roll culture you cat couldn't really take part in it too much because you have to run a magazine you are to publish that Banksy were all how can I ask that question you could do both but you really one has to sacrifice for the other I mean once it gets going and as you try impressing me every two weeks you really have no time to think of anything but the next day more copy more stories and all the little things that go into a mouse the mail room is healthier and how did you fund it did you have to also put of course adds I'm assuming right well we're trying to sell as we get a few ads here in entertainment there was not much revenue they might get five hundred dollars an issue in advertising at the beginning so how much runway did you have with that seven hundred dollars was funny because as that would go out the means to gain some eyes in from selling it at newsstands in the BB checks from that some advertisers and people might start striving paying five dollars We are sorry that so you know there's enough to keep it going that sooner or later we hired our first employee got to see twenty five dollars a week and by the end of the first year we were a viable business with three or four people being paid getting at regularly sung thirty or forty thousand copies an issue people were responding to the back comes to liking we're getting letters and correspondence and recognition from various artists in the first year we bought a long interview with Pete Townsend Jagger so it was making gather momentum people liked what they saw the DQ have that advantage because you were the only magazine <Music/Noise> there well yes nobody else is trying to do this I mean the primary mainstream press didn't <Music/Noise> care at all about this particular corner of American culture or give much credence or thought the idea there's a kind a booming new generation about over the baby was going to have a big impact in that time still useable looked down upon as teenage <Music/Noise> ephemeral disabled people really strange <Music/Noise> long hair cannot <Music/Noise> accept all people but unless the music was the kind of tribal Telegraph the drums are beating for young people around the world can communicate with each other to other people like them around <Music/Noise> so this is the way young people communicate there was nothing else <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> said You remember what worked when the magazine started to get attention was it a year to three like one one to study becomes and people just talk about when the first time the goal of tensions on the first year anniversary we printed the cover the band two versions cover the alma John Yoko John Bonner did get the one that shot them and back sides and then act picture of them and completely naked so we ran as our first anniversary issue am a guy article about ourselves in a sense of the first press which was telling his New Deal perils SF but we had we sold out the printing the print more than just Kai got more more people talking and then I think in her too big especially young groupies that cause more tension with the photo for him before about girls of all bands around <Music/Noise> associated bad that I think led to an article in Time magazine about us so we're starting to get a little on the national <Music/Noise> you know sales are picking up the big cities around the sky spreads by word of mouth and then find me a deal with more of a national magazine wholesaler threaten a company's Francisco and start appearing more more run the country the more we hear the more like a more subscriptions came and more babies came in so we felt we really had a going business you know after the first year we had a question about survival committed <Music/Noise> the <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> crush her counsel because it's fair to say he was your first really big breakthrough writer I add new hunters work before spiraling stone earring a book called The Hells Angel on and so I just wrote a letter after this I really don't ask him to write something for us and he wrote back saying geez he didn't really want reading was stone is terrific and great but he loved to write but he couldn't lie now because he was busy involved in running for sheriff of Aspen Colorado so I wrote an actual wanted to write about that and which she did and which we publish couple months later was called the Battle of Aspen or free power in the Rockies and of course the idea the running for sheriff of Aspen caught norms and attention in media place around the world of sudden he was inundated with reporters and film crews from New York from London suffer like that that was once again is just our reputation growing more more so in nineteen seventy two I mean at what I mean I'm I was a huge fan of her Thompson's work and when I was special and I was younger and I mean you have signed this guy to cover the nineteen seventy two McGovern campaign a serious presidential campaign was any part of you like me this is all risky this guys you know the sky the use of drugs in these a little bit nuts and maybe the maybe I think that's what it took me by that time hundreds and a couple of serious deep investigative pieces for us on the geese Elena check on the road there he had we done feeling off Vegas and he had become our star writer star reporter saw was always on look after will be the next great thing for Ana to do here so the election comes along in the first time they hills or franchise to vote is in any war situation is those antiwar election and Hunter had this camp low back or having one for Sharon mean very mean actually covered Nixon years before so it was just kind of a natural thing I mean American politics why not send out an expert on Hell's Angels to do American politics made for sense the <Music/Noise> just a moment why Rolling Stones ditch San Francisco for New York and how it became the most influential music magazine <Music/Noise> in the world stay with us listening to how I built this from NPR <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise>

ticket you can go to NPR presents dot o RG the the Halo combat to hide this from NPR and Kai rise till it's the early nineteen seventies and Rolling Stone is trying to get a lot of national attention at this point is operating out of a brand new office in a magazine even starts to publish in color they just decide Hunter S Thompson the brilliant acid dropping Gonzo journalist cover the nineteen seventy two presidential election nothing says you get gas and power that may be even better than that that was that was a traditional journals was no radical way over but you had I mean look if you're trying to make a presidential election at that time interesting to young people if you are basically turned off the political process you have to engage them in a kind of colorful and interesting and the government is an interesting personality and mix at that time is clear well defined villain so it was kind of setup for doing really good writing reporting and embrace the traditional coverage of the bloodless and I went and broke all that apart and became the most compelling writer and reporter on that campaign as everybody will acknowledge what was he like to work with the mean was he a reliable way is he reliable some of the word erratic hundred Circle love we call handling I mean he was erratic in his movie An energetic and all of the map but he was also a professional superb reporter Brian Rider deep sense of responsibility about things and though he would work in to the very last minute deadline and almost drive me crazy and bring you right here in the end yet we still are you could always count on him to do so so I was I had a great time took a lot of my time it was draining exhausting thing do but the net effect was to produce a brilliant piece of work in terms of cover the entire election and was also one of the key things that really finally put links on the map and a big way yeah everybody in the press corps was reading Every on the campaign misery and people are riveted by what he had to say but by that time we're pretty serious rock roll magazine pre why the respective style advertising lot of advertising record companies and that we are away so that was in Indy we would know growing pains well after about three years we went to a real brush with running out of money which lasted a couple of months because it moved offices sexism from Red Friel often appears place of big expensive new to expand them off so then all the overhead that entails and we're spending money without really thinking about all semester my God you're right out of money and with switch to a big national distributors are also now premiums like three hundred foreigner thousand and once we got through that we start and you know professional analyzing our management I mean really actually bring in people who are CP A's or had accounting degrees or had some weasel business background that can manage things and keep track of the money and over the years that just got more more professional but I knew once we moved we moved to New York in nineteen seventy seven I mean that really was finding it was really hitting the big why did the New York The Elijah Elijah Lee Francisco and seven said well we were yelled the company by that time was split into half of an service call and have are a lot of people on the writers and readers and so we had to do in one place and also the magazine business was in New York so if you want all the resources of talent they were veiled in your quest for the industry so was kind of <Music/Noise> brand that that's what we do and we went and did end up on Fifth Avenue at the time young you were quoted as saying Cisco is a cultural backwater and that so moving did you teach users some truth to that you really feel that oh yeah I mean there there was that heyday only started which had not only this thriving rock roll culture to thrive youth culture thriving political culture on the left of the black pants and all sorts of things wrapped presents and just sort of by the time we moved from New York was trying to have its moment has come back to life and we arrived just at that time was around four holes and then there's wasn't so much closer backwaters was it was just the provincial out on the coast was often the mainstream it wasn't putting up this big unique culture thing is that the the Gil yon trying to head into contracts or get myself into that then New York office in early nineteen seventies Rolling Stone was basically espousing a kind of counterculture a static but you're the boss man you were them and so has New balance running a counterculture magazine also being a boss and kind of having to be probably a jerk sometimes to people who weren't you know for active or whatever well I mean it wasn't too difficult for some I never quite believed in the counterculture or call that an altar call for maybe but definitely you know you had certain value systems of trying to go and try and be fair to people instead of being ruthless money only is the on the accounts so it was always a bit of a balancing act but I think every week we understand that they everybody wanted to get paid you know if you have families human support them so I don't think anybody really deeply question the need to have a prophet ethic and professional ethics I mean there were some outside critics in the early days of people owe your principles of this beer heavy capitalists and it's kind of contradiction out the stamp vote but I miss stuff that wasn't nothing I really paid attention and at that point were you just have to really get interested in the business side of things are you looking at tpy n Al's re looking at the bottom line were you doing that too well again I was myself doing is I was always had something there as CEO or CFO who had the day to day responsibility for all that and that person report to me and I look at our hse have oversight over it and try to understand and try to give directions and strategic advice but I didn't have control of the day out on this control get it but when you're involved in something like in the stages that when things are growing all the time in getting better and more might come in yet to be too tough"
