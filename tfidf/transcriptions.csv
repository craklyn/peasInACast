with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After four years and over sixteen hundred E O Fire episodes it is family time Fire Nation my first book will be available in twenty seventeen the title How to Finally when create your dream life one step at a time for years now I see on when you are scared to lose losing <Music/Noise> the problem I lose every single day the problem is how can you finally win visit How to Finally when dot com for a sneak peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from Sequoia Capital and their worth over a billion dollars in so he's the classic entrepreneur story that <Music/Noise> you know I come to America with very little and now he's literally <Music/Noise> one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley and as long <Music/Noise> that equity money <Music/Noise> the company <Music/Noise> on a good path exactly because her lesson today on fire with a

those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to

with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't

products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the

peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from Sequoia Capital and their worth over a billion dollars in so he's the classic entrepreneur story that <Music/Noise> you know I come to America with very little and now he's literally <Music/Noise> one

"5","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you

<Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour

a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the

saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in

category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went

"8","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I

entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that

that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After four years and over sixteen hundred E O Fire episodes it is family time Fire Nation my first book will be available in twenty seventeen the title How to Finally when create your dream life one step at a time for years now I see on when you are scared to lose losing <Music/Noise> the problem I lose every single day the problem is how can you finally win visit How to Finally when dot com for a sneak peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise>

nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I

"11","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a

chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After four years and over sixteen hundred E O Fire episodes it is family time Fire Nation my first book will be available in twenty seventeen the title How to Finally when create your dream life one step at a time for years now I see on when you are scared to lose losing <Music/Noise> the problem I lose every single day the problem is how can you finally win visit How to Finally when dot com for a sneak peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from Sequoia Capital and their worth over a billion dollars in so he's the classic entrepreneur story that <Music/Noise> you know I come to America with very little and now he's literally <Music/Noise> one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley and as long <Music/Noise> that equity money <Music/Noise> the company <Music/Noise> on a good path exactly because her lesson today on fire with a

those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I

chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street

I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those

grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in

more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred

peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from Sequoia Capital and their worth over a billion dollars in so he's the classic entrepreneur story that <Music/Noise> you know I come to America with very little and now he's literally <Music/Noise> one

"16","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a

and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is

working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful

chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the

seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in

category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their

knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise>

<Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot

"19","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry

gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After four years and over sixteen hundred E O Fire episodes it is family time Fire Nation my first book will be available in twenty seventeen the title How to Finally when create your dream life one step at a time for years now I see on when you are scared to lose losing <Music/Noise> the problem I lose every single day the problem is how can you finally win visit How to Finally when dot com for a sneak peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise>

John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it

"22","EOFire Podcast","Christopher_Locchead_5.22.17.mp3","lights that spark Fire <Music/Noise> a jail <Music/Noise> ins are welcome to Episode seventeen hundred in twenty eight of EO fire I am chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a

chatting with today's most aspiring aunts viewers a seven he's weak if you're ready to mash reported to the master discipline in Master focus in one hundred days visit the mastery Journal dot CA now share with a featured guest Christopher Locke Ed Chris for a prepare two nights I absolutely am ready to light myself and everybody else fire Christopher is the coauthor of plea big or how pirates dreamers and innovators create and dominate markets he's the co hosts of the legends and losers podcast he's a former three time public company C M O and entrepreneur Chris or take a minute fill some gaps from that shown give us a little glimpse your personal life well first of all John thanks of course for having the big fan of the show and I'm someone who got thrown out of school at eighteen for being stupid I found out at twenty one that I'm dyslexic and so the alternatives I had lived for work a manual labor job I was an orderly at a hospital so I could either <Music/Noise> she will guys you know what's for a living or I could start a company and so with my friend Jack I decided to start a company and today I'm retired CIA mole living in beautiful Santa Cruz California home and I surf a lot and I'm married to an extraordinary <Music/Noise> with an amazing tribe of people and most days I feel like this must be heaven I love all of that sin really take it's a sometimes <Music/Noise> Chris for that you didn't quite think was having before we get there the breakdown for Fire Nation <Music/Noise> you consider your area of expertise what is that probably my biggest area of expertise John is I am what you could call category designer expound yes so it turns out that most people when they think about marketing they make an unconscious choice to participate in an existing market that was designed <Music/Noise> purposely or accidently by somebody else so there <Music/Noise> in every market and a market or a category is really a way of thinking about a problem in a solution and so most entrepreneurs when they go to launch their company or their product or new version of their product or service they make an unconscious choice to compete in an existing space or category and what I've learned over thirty years and we did three quarters of a million dollars in research for a book play bigger is that legends actually teach the market or the category to think about a problem in a solution in a particular way and as a result John they set up the rules of a whole new category and so I spent the last thirty years of my life trying to train myself how to design new categories Fire Nation will be getting deeper in disguise and deep seated beliefs right <Music/Noise> as well The Real Quick Race for what do you <Music/Noise> sure our listeners gets from your area of expertise was that one thing that we probably don't know but should know is on trailers here's the one that I hope makes the biggest difference and certainly will help increase the odds for such matters so when you talk to entrepreneurs or any kind innovator John at least in my experience what I found as they essentially pulled two big levers one is products last service they think that if they build a legendary carpeting you later and a legendary company to deliver the carpeting you later to the world and everything works and whatever challenge comes up or opportunity for that matter think oh great more products or features or expand our geography more salespeople or peed on the street product product product company Company Company Here's we know the legends pull a third lever and levers called category they designed a new product company and category and they position themselves as distinct and if they get all three right we call it prosecute the magic triangle product company in category you get to be Pablo Picasso or Mark Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely and I went on for a now because you Chris for have treated your version of heaven which is amazing and the sky what <Music/Noise> for Fire Nation to live in what we consider our own version of heaven but You were always there you have the abs had the Downs ins I want you to take as to what you consider your worst arch Mariel then it today so Christopher don't pull any punches brother take is there tell us the story yeah well you know John one of the reasons we called our show ledges or losers is because we really believe you can't be a legend without being a loser <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> I I love that and so there's been a tremendous amount of if you'll allow the word loser <Music/Noise> probably the worst one was you know I started at eighteen with no options and that's why I became a doctor I didn't even know the word entrepreneur and twenty one that first company had failed and sell at the time there was a recession and I was having a really hard time getting a job I was newly <Music/Noise> and so there I was twenty one years old a field on Twitter are in debt up to my eyeballs and I really was completely at a loss for what to do with my life with you that point I mean you kind of on the floor there you kind of grasping its rise nothing's really working with what happens when you hit the bottom when you scrape the rock pile well first of all I'm scared is as ass Jesus we sang as all the something yeah so I'm terrified I feel like a failure and even worse than that you know my good looks are not such that I can go to the grocery store and smile and they give me a bag of food and so I can ski for your pretty looking guy for having <Music/Noise> had I thank you I appreciate it wasn't enough for the folks down at the grocers drop that and so i like alot alot of people young people who were lost had to get a job but luckily you know I learned <Music/Noise> John that relationships matter and I try to build great relationships in one of the companies that I had to create a partnership with my first business was another entrepreneur and he was starting a new company and he asked me to join as the head of sales of that company and within a year I was able to help start the company and believe it or not pay off my debt and move forward in my life and career hone in <Music/Noise> Fire Nation really <Music/Noise> ship's last known time Johnny done now over seventeen hundred episodes like what's the biggest thing the thing is going to be to your personal success in growing and fired a seven figure your business since just one work relationships and I did not <Music/Noise> I started <Music/Noise> that the gas there will <Music/Noise> women comprise an hour seventeen hundred alumni Reagan to be the reason that has much success they have today because I was clueless I was naive I was inexperienced I was flat out stupid in some areas but I learned my lessons I educated myself I learn from every single gas and I built those relationships relationships and matter and that's what Chris does well <Music/Noise> to build from nothing to what he is saying he'll never forget that lesson on ever forget that lesson Chris I mean it's a little bit of your thunder there was exactly what you said but I want you to pick out <Music/Noise> thing that you want to make sure the Fire Nation really gets from like a lesson <Music/Noise> from that worse moment to tell is that you College on the aha moment and the big aha moment for me really <Music/Noise> working life is could be summed up with the expression position yourself or be positioned and so Muhammad Ali famously said I don't tell among the greatest in the world how they got to know I I And so even though I was a failed on Twitter with no education <Music/Noise> at very few relationships that I'm certainly no experience and I did have a belief in myself I did drop a family that was incredibly supportive and back me from the beginning and so I was able to muster that sort of courage and your point on relationships somehow I didn't know I wasn't I wasn't out networking you don't I mean I was just trying to build my freakin business trying to do something with my life and this guy's name was Bill Walker I guess took a shine to me he was an older entrepreneur more successful entrepreneur and I called him to tell him we had failed and he said Well what are you doing and I said I don't know nice it was about to go on vacation he wait a week because I'm starting a new company and love you to come help me and so what things I hear a lot today John as you know you should go and build relationships and you should network and you should do this step and I think it's a bit of a fallacy in that we want to go out and build relationships but not for the sake of building relationships of you know I mean I had built a relationship with this guy Bill Walker by doing business by really trying to add value to his business and hopefully he was trying to do the same and so when he saw I was available I think what he saw was a young determined driven young man had been knocked down and he gave me that hand to pick me up but I don't want anybody to think I was out there like hanging out at parties just hang in and handing out business cards hoping somebody would discover me I was I was out there hustling position it yourself or be positioned Fire Nation lovely <Music/Noise> great takeaway in Chris let's be frank that was your greatest aha moments to date if your life I mean as you share but you had a lots of great ideas lot of aha moment was to do now is to take us to one of those great ideas one of the greatest takes that Monica tells the story for that aha moment developed and how you turned it into success so I was a young entrepreneur working on my second startup living in Toronto Canada I grew up in Montreal and I was in the technology industry John and I saw the very early days of water that I was called Salesforce automation and I was very excited about it because I love sales and marketing and I love technology I was a young guy in my twenties and I kind of had this spider sense if you will that there was this new category developing that that sell what became CRM customer relationship management was taking off for the time is very nice and I thought you know what self if you're smart you were you you would be on the front and to this massive new category and in addition <Music/Noise> you know I John I'm gonna be the Pied Piper that leads this parade I'm going to be one of the guys on the front and of this whole new exciting area and I sort of declared myself a thought leader in customer relationship management and I went out I did a lot of speaking in writing and so for that I position <Music/Noise> small boutique consultancy at the time as the leader <Music/Noise> category of technology that was my first real experience understanding that you could design a category you can really teach the world and therefore a market to think about a problem to solution in a particular way and if you did that successfully in you if you use what you can think of as a point of view to position <Music/Noise> as the eye that the head of this new category that was a way to catapult yourself or to add a very powerful domain as opposed to trying to be you know the four hundred and thirty seven dentist in my town Fire Nation there is always a massive <Music/Noise> new category that's around the corner <Music/Noise> in is happening all the time so you have that opportunity to be the first move you the opportunity to be that Pied Piper but what he need to do to have patients number one hinge on every new opportunity because even though it might be a good one may not be for you France is like riding a blogger back in two thousand six other with a great opportunity for me I was <Music/Noise> I was never to be the DSL you know I passed on those type of things I had patience but keeping on the pulse and if it's the right category of history thing of such opportunity then you pounce and then you become that first move or you had that first movers advantage of experience with podcasting so that momentum builds up with Yeo and you get Piper you create that category and you really hold the flag and you have people march to your being said you march into everybody else's beats out the other <Music/Noise> hate to interrupt you but I just you know how many opportunities that you actually are and intuitive category designer and so one of things we found an A in the work of play bigger is category designers who are intuitive about it teach the world to think about a product company in a category unholy way and so everything you did with arch were on fire <Music/Noise> you early in podcasting which can make a difference but it turns <Music/Noise> package on it's not just being early Facebook was two or three years later than most of the quote girly social networks you got the magic triangle right product company category your product the podcast was a unique design a lot of ways we could unpack that and you positioned it very <Music/Noise> this word on purpose John differently and so by being different not better people could understand what category your podcast was like Oh this guy's really different every day it's always such winners and all the other things about your form in your approach and so you created a category of podcast which you could dominate and so the way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far just wait for the Lightning Round after we get back from thinking our sponsors Fire Nation my three greatest strength our productivity discipline in focus and it took me four years to master the skills and they are the reasons I been able to build a fire <Music/Noise> <Music/Noise> business good news I've created a step by step guide for you to master these three skills as well in one hundred days is called the mastery Journal master productivity discipline and focus in one hundred days to learn more and begin your journey of mastering the skills says it's the mastery Journal dot com After four years and over sixteen hundred E O Fire episodes it is family time Fire Nation my first book will be available in twenty seventeen the title How to Finally when create your dream life one step at a time for years now I see on when you are scared to lose losing <Music/Noise> the problem I lose every single day the problem is how can you finally win visit How to Finally when dot com for a sneak peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that very rarely does somebody ever say to us hey John thanks for talking I love the talent is only used it twice and you cried and then everytime after that is mine so this is how yours and I find his knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from Sequoia Capital and their worth over a billion dollars in so he's the classic entrepreneur story that <Music/Noise> you know I come to America with very little and now he's literally <Music/Noise> one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley and as long <Music/Noise> that equity money <Music/Noise> the company <Music/Noise> on a good path exactly because her lesson today on fire with a

way I think about what you did is you know if you want to get Nouveau <Music/Noise> got to define your <Music/Noise> that's exactly what you did it products company category Fire Nation thing about those three things How are you incorporating that into your business your life and Chris for real brother Phoebe drop in value bombs like that interrupts away <Music/Noise> the gas on <Music/Noise> the spotlight let's talk about right now what you think the number one thing is that you are most fire about today well in my life that new thing I'm most fires up about why podcast ledges are losers because I don't have to tell you John you get to have incredible conversations with incredible people and so it's really it's funny I've been you know legends loses about three months old and I can't imagine not having it in my life right but but the reason for it is so our book play bigger came out in June of twenty sixteen and as it was coming out John I read an article in The Wall Street Journal that knocked me on my behind in the headline of the story said the crisis in American entrepreneurship as I read the story you could see its online and they quote a bunch of MIT in Brookings Institute a research in the net of it is more countries in the United States die every week that are founded and the millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history and I'm someone for whom John entrepreneur ship was no way out not the way up I couldn't go to school there was no school for me at the time they threw me out I'm dyslexic and I didn't fit and for those of us you know I think there's some people in the world John who they can find their place in <Music/Noise> and God bless him if you can find your place in the world and then there's those of us who grew up on the Island of misfit toys and we have to make our place in <Music/Noise> my point is a big part of why I started legends and losers was people who read play bigger wanted to participate in more dialogue around category designs of the things we talk about today but in addition to that John this may sound corny but I wanted to dedicate the back half of my life to trying to make a difference for arch winners and a spark entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial success because it from a large readership was a way out of a life of struggle it wasn't like Oh well I was going to Harvard and you know if this doesn't work out I'll just get a job at Google that's not what was happening for Bee Yan Fire Nation we think that even the top of the top the lease like with Google I mean Fire Nation point zero two percent is the accepted rate into Google right now so even people that think they are on that elite path I mean they're in for a hard road so why not have that Swiss Army knife like approach of an Ottoman or we have all the skills center matter what industry what sector what a nice crash is ur ears the whole economy comes down as what you know how to make it happen I don't want to compare on the cockroaches but I mean <Music/Noise> is cockroaches survive when the catastrophe happened on New Years do as well we made it to thrive as much as as as we do in the good times but we had that skill set to keep driving for Fire Nation so built that skill set that will protect you in times to comment if you think that Chris has been dropping value bomb so far

peek at the first chapter gives details and more how to finally win it back down Chris are you ready to rock the lightning rounds ready to turn the Marshal Les Pauls up to eleven I was at school of its woes holding you back from becoming an entrepreneur well I mean I had no experience I was eighteen right no experience no money no relationships we of course no education and so I said I didn't really even know the word you know the joke I had heard once I did hear the word was on Twitter was a fat fancy word for unemployed I I what is the best advice you've ever received well I want to stay PG on <Music/Noise> so I'll just share it this way from what I mean by that <Music/Noise> I'm middle school punk rocker and I think which winners are warriors and and and people listen every legendary product or service that we love exists because an <Music/Noise> entrepreneur <Music/Noise> was absolutely unwilling to let their innovation do anything other than thrive and they got product company category right and the created something new that opened the world up to something amazing and in order to do that you have to be willing to if you will hike the future that you want and there's going to be a lot of people who tell us that we can have that future I was told that I had to get an MBA stop swearing <Music/Noise> to play golf and I said F it to all of those things and I just went forward with my life and my career you only have to stop swearing during the twenty minute you're on fire so thank you for that Christie is trying a lot of parents <Music/Noise> trying to expose their kids to the wonderful world of art from your ship so I saw those kids those out there thanks for listening <Music/Noise> all the parents yes we will be keeping your fire PG Chris was a personal habit contributes to your success shut up shut up shut up in the more we showed up the more we learn those of us in sales the more <Music/Noise> out the more war they buy and I I got out early John that

knees while we have two years in one mouth sounds just recognize that and he shared Internet resource like ever notes with Fire Nation yeah my favorite internet resource is Zoo and Zoo <Music/Noise> year old company that has created a magical cloud web based communications technology for conference call A and I think it's imagine if Skype and and web access had a legendary baby it would be assumed and I'm happy to say we just had Eric you and the founder of zoom who is a billion dollar what's called a unicorn company here in Silicon Valley we just had among legends losers and <Music/Noise> but we shoot <Music/Noise> on zoom I know I also don't really want to travel very much John nice to travel to three thousand miles year and so I do most of my meetings resume their incredible and I love them and I have no financial interest in the company I just think they're awesome and I wish Eric and his team incredible luck in transforming the way we all communicate yeah as you live by the way if I was doing anything had to do with video for the podcast was a video podcast it would be on <Music/Noise> us on day long whenever <Music/Noise> asked me Hey John how she shoot my video podcast I say zoom us make it happen like I could I ever had with a quick story about err yeah he's a classical much better story right he had internet starts to take ah he's an engineer living in China he says I want to be part of this thing I got to get to the US turns out he has a body whose building Web axe and he gets a job I think he was Number twelve at Webb acts as an entire day just build himself up and now he's the founder zoom in zoom is a company that is growing somewhere between two and three hundred percent a year they just raised one hundred million dollars from
